# Effects of Vaccination on  Immunity and on SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Transmission and Evolution

## Summary
The admitted vaccines are administrated into the muscle and mostly use the spike as antigen. This produces a strong IgG antibody response with neutralising capabilities. People immunised like this tend to have lower viral in the upper respiratory tract and are less likely to develop typical Covid symptoms or ADRS. Less is published about other effects of spike-muscle vaccination such as the duration of asymptomatic infections, the effect on evolution and transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2. Here we look what is known from other respiratory viruses e.g. it is observed for influenza A that once symptomatic aerosol transmission is increased or for delta coronaviruses that vaccines can yield additional immune escape  evolution.

## Introduction
At the end of the 19 century, it was observed that the blood serum can neutralise pathogens. The substances doing so were named antibodies and that the immune system part producing them is the learned immune system. Antibodies in the blood serum are still important and widespread used due to their easy detection. However the immune system has many more parts which gets often forgotten by the focus on serum IgG. The current admitted vaccines produce mainly high levels of spike targeting IgG antibodies. This is a different immunity than the body produces upon natural infection. In the trials it has been shown that the Cov-spike-into-muscle vaccines induced immunity prevents symptomatic and ADRS like disease pattern. Public research has also shown that Cov-spike-into-muscle vaccinated people tend to have lower viral loads in the upper respiratory tract (mostly NPS sampling). Other effects of vaccination are less published but still relevant to determine which groups to immunise and how to optimally immunise them:
* What kind of immunity is induced by the different methods of immunisation?
	> For vaccines applied to the deltoid muscle the immune response is often systemic e.g. IgG but not well in the middle respiratory tract.
	
* What's the effect of the primed immunity upon infection? How the disease is changed?
	> A systemically primed immune system may keep the infection away from the deep lungs and prevent ARDS disease patterns. However the infection may be longer or even persistent in the bronchi.
	
* Are the transmission pathways changed and if yes which?
	> Aerosol
	
* What effect has vaccination on the adaption and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.
	> Spike only vaccination may produce a single sided immune response, which the viruses can out mutate quickly.

### Immune Response upon Vaccination
Mostly it has been published that the admitted vaccinations produces some (or a lot of) IgG. For 'mRNA' vaccines also T cells are produced. By independent research groups it is shown that most vaccines fail to produce IgA. 

### Immune Response upon Infection depending on Vaccine Status
However few is published about what happens upon infection. 
* Are the IgG globulins up-scaled? Stay they constant because they are already high enough or the body judges them as not adequate against respiratory infections?
* Are the IgA globulins up-scaled? More quickly than at SARS-2 unexposed people?  // It can be that the main protection of the vaccines results from the knowledge of the antibodies to target SARS-2 and not from the IgG levels in the blood. If that's the case much lower doses of vaccines could be sufficient - offering near the same protection at lower risks for unwanted effects.

### Disease Progression and Pattering
How the vaccination primed immune system alters SARS-CoV-2 infections is unclear:
* Which locations are infected? Or concretely in which specimens SARS-2 RNA is detected? In NPS samples, saliva samples, endotracheal lavage fluid, bronchealveolar lavage fluid? E.g. it could be that mainly the bronchi are infected but not the alveoli. This is possible since the bronchial epithelium is less protected by IgG, but the alveolar cells are protected by IgG.
* Is the clearance faster or slower. Longer infection durations or even persistent infections are possible if the only the bronchial epithelium but not the alveolar macrophages are infected, in this case there may be no strong immune response.

Background: For vaccinated people at baseline there's much IgG but few IgA. The viruses may be mainly prevented from infecting the alveoli (which corresponds to the observations that vaccines reduce the frequency of ARDS).
