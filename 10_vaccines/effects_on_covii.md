## Effects of  the different Methods of Vaccination on  SARS-CoV-2 infections

### Immune Responses upon Infection
Mostly it has been published that the admitted vaccinations produces some (or a lot of) IgG. Some show that also T cells are primed. By independent research groups it is shown that most vaccines fail to produce IgA. 

However few is published about what happens upon infection. 
* Are the IgG globulins up-scaled? Stay they constant because they are already high enough or the body judges them as not adequate against respiratory infections?
* Are the IgA globulins up-scaled? More quickly than at SARS-2 unexposed people?  // It can be that the main protection of the vaccines results from the knowledge of the antibodies to target SARS-2 and not from the IgG levels in the blood. If that's the case much lower doses of vaccines could be sufficient - offering near the same protection at lower risks for unwanted effects.

### Disease Progression and Pattering
How the vaccination primed immune system alters SARS-CoV-2 infections is unclear:
* Which locations are infected? Or concretely in which specimens SARS-2 RNA is detected? In NPS samples, saliva samples, endotracheal lavage fluid, bronchealveolar lavage fluid? E.g. it could be that mainly the bronchi are infected but not the alveoli. This is possible since the bronchial epithelium is less protected by IgG, but the alveolar cells are protected by IgG.
* Is the clearance faster or slower. Longer infection durations or even persistent infections are possible if the only the bronchial epithelium but not the alveolar macrophages are infected, in this case there may be no strong immune response.

Background: For vaccinated people at baseline there's much IgG but few IgA. The viruses may be mainly prevented from infecting the alveoli (which corresponds to the observations that vaccines reduce the frequency of ARDS).
