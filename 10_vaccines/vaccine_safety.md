# Vaccine Safety and (open?) Questions

> __Rolling publication_ since young and healthy people and in some regions even children are not only allowed and motivated but often pressured to take vaccines deemed as safe. Here it is argued that the observed tolerable symptoms do *not* guarantee safety. 

> Some adverse effects are **speculative** but if healthy people are motivated or even pressured to vaccinate, in my opinion, the safety must be proven and not just be suspected. Innocent people may have life-long adverse effects or even die for a supposed considerate and safe action. // I just read yesterday (12.6.21) about a 18 year old person who died likely because of vaccination.

> Additionally it is summer for the coming months on the Northern hemisphere and so no need to rush vaccinating the young and healthy.

> This section is partly subjective. My knowledge of adenoviruses and how transfected RNA works and what it can cause is very limited. However, I am not sure whether anybody understands RNA. RNA can do a lot. In public discussions about 'mRNA' vaccine safety, views, outdated for decades are widespread e.g. that RNA is always degraded fast and its only used to message protein-encodings:
> * RNA is always degraded fast? This is *wrong*. 
> * RNA is  just a messenger for protein translation? Not completely wrong, since a small fraction of all RNA is indeed used to message proteins.

> I am thankful to be informed when and which of the points below are wrong or the safety regarding them is known.

## Summary
Symptom watching and surveillance is usually enough for attenuated live pathogen [vaccines](./vaccines.md#vaccine) since it is known what to except: the disease intended to prevent. When the symptoms are tolerable and limited the disease is not caused and so the vaccine is much safer than natural infection. However this method of tolerable symptoms watching is often not enough to ensure the safety of other vaccines technologies. Only the safety of vaccines where a thorough understanding of their behavior in the body can be assess by symptoms alone. Whether tolerable symptoms predict vaccine safety, depends on the technology, the exact formulation and mode of action of a vaccine:
* Even for live pathogen vaccines tolerable disease symptoms watching can be tricky. E.g. an AIDS vaccine based on the wild type AIDS virus will pass a short term tolerable symptom test and antibodies will be detected. =>  the kinetics of the pathogen is needed since *not* for all pathogens short term watching is enough.
* For vaccines with adjuvants, safety depends both on the antigens inoculated and the adjuvant. => The safety of the adjuvants needs to be ensured.
* Transfected RNA ('mRNA' vaccines) may enter arbitrary tissues and cells: Transfection of the wrong cells such as long-lived neurones, stem cells or immune cells can have bad and long lasting effects. Upon transfection many things can happen e.g. cell death can be caused. => For mRNA vaccines it is mandatory to know the tissue and cell kinetics and the exact sequence and nucleoside modifications.
* For adenovirus based vaccines the adenovirus species and its characterization is needed e.g.  how they distribute, which cells they attach or infect and the clearance kinetics. Haemagglutination is observed for many adenoviruses, which is possibly the cause of the observed thrombosis events. Which could be prevented e.g. by dosage or administration adaption.



## Introduction
There are different definitions of immunisation and vaccination around. Here a general definition is used: *Immunisation* prepares the immune system to something. *Vaccination* teaches the immune system to recognize something and thereby provide prevent disease. 



## Why Symptom Surveillance is often Not enough for Safety
Early vaccines were based on live pathogens. Usually related life-forms providing cross immunity or the same pathogen but attenuated. For such vaccines the main concern is to cause the disease which is intended to be prevented and this happens from time to time. Most (but not all) diseases cause immediate symptoms and as long there are no or few symptoms there's usually no damage caused. For attenuated pathogen vaccines which cause immediate diseases, it is enough to watch for symptoms and detect whether the disease in question is caused. 
Later on one started to use adjuvants (substances increasing the immune response) for such the trials already may fail e.g. aluminum or mercury can be used and pass symptom tests (mercury is known to be harmful therefore it is not used).

### Symptom Surveillance is Enough If
Symptom surveillance is enough when one knows what to except including possible adverse effects can be predicted. All the following points should be true:
* The pathogens or substances in question  cause immediate adverse effects. E.g. many pathogens of acute diseases don't stay latent in the human body but they replicate an either growth or decrease approximately exponentially.
* The kinetics of the medication is known:
	* The distribution of the medication within the body is known.
	* It is known how, how fast and the which products the medication in question is metabolized.
	* It is known that the medication is cleared during the surveillance period.
	
### Symptom Surveillance is NOT Enough If
Symptom surveillance is *not* enough when 
* the excepted symptoms are unknown or hard to diagnose: e.g. detecting an immune disorder can require years of careful investigations.
* the kinetics is *not* known or *not* favorable: If the kinetics is not known the surveillance period needs to be set to lifetime to exclude unwanted effects.

Examples where symptoms surveillance alone is difficult or not doable:
* Substance or pathogens with a bad kinetics: 
	* Even tough low doses of mercury pass a symptom test, it enriches in the human body and can be neurotoxic. The latter is known for mercury therefore it is not used anymore as medicine.
	* The safety of aluminum as adjuvant is still unclear despite being in use for 90 years. Nevertheless, some risks of adverse effects can worth it to avoid smallpox or polio.
	* Wild type aids viruses easily pass a short time symptom test. The problem is however they build their genome into long-lived immune cells and therefore AIDS infections are usually life long.
* Substances which cause subtle and hard to diagnose damage. E.g. MDMA (ecstasy) can damage neurone in the brain and cause a slight loss in mental performance. Such effects are hard to detect and not detected in simple symptom tests.
* Substance where the kinetics or the pattern of damage is unknown. E.g. it lasted years until aids was discovered since to causally link the observed disease, namely an increased to susceptibility to secondary infections, to the AIDS virus was and is difficult.
 

### Covid Vaccine Trials
Regarding the current mRNA and vector technologies long term and subtle health hazards are possible too. The published trials only discuss symptoms. Relevant considerations such as the tissue tropism and the exact sequences are not mentioned. To me this is strange and not understandable.

> Subtle damage (e.g. brain damage similar to MDMA or stem cell damage) are especially relevant when vaccinating children or repeated vaccination.

> It is unclear whether vaccines companies spend enough time and resources to ensure the safety. Especially if the rumoured contracts are true which frees them from liability.

> In my opinion such contracts should be waved unless the companies go open source with the entire vaccine technology stack such that an independent safety assessment is possible. If they don't want the vaccine companies can buy insurances, at least the 'mRNA' vaccines are sold with margin large enough that insurances can be paid if severe adverse effects are unlikely.



## Kinetics of the Vaccines
An important property to estimate possible effects of things is their kinetics. Kinetics denotes here the temporal and spacial behavior of things i.e. the distribution, clearance and clearance paths. It is a generalisation of pharmacokinetics to things: not just pharmaceutical drugs but any-thing which can distribute in the body such as pathogens including viruses.
As for viruses tropism for cells or tissues, is used to denote which the cells or tissues are frequently subject to infection.


Some points relevant for Covid vaccines are:
* *Tissues:* To which tissues the vaccines are distributed?
	If the vaccines reside within the deltoid muscle where administrated, possible direct effects are mostly localized there. If they vaccines are distributed systemically effects are not localized and much harder to diagnose. 
	
	> Also there tissues like the bone marrow or the brain where damage is not wanted.

* *Cells:* What's the cell tropism of the vaccines i.e. which cells they preferably attach and enter?

	> Most cells are subject to the cell turnover which means die and replaced by new ones. So these cells don't live throughout one lifetime but shorter, usually much shorter. E.g. the cells in the respiratory tract epithelium are replaced within weeks. For this reason Covid-19 unlikely causes long lasting adverse effects as long as only the respiratory tract is infected (in rare cases, mostly severe infections and when the immune system is not good, the SARS-2 viruses can spread via the blood to other organs). 
	
	> On the other hand it is usually bad if long-lived neurones or stem cells are infected. These cell are usually well protected by the body: deep within tissues or even within the bones and additionally these cell usually don't express many receptors so virus can't easily enter.
	
* How long the the vaccines reside within the body? 
	Knowing the decay is mandatory to know the timescales of possible side effects. 
	
	> Animal experiments or pathology of deaths temporarily associated to vaccination including full sequencing would help to bring clarity. 


### Kinetics of mRNA Vaccines
The kinetics is especially needed for "mRNA vaccines" since these small capsules could enter arbitrary tissues and cells. Killing or altering long lived cells can have the same effects as ageing e.g. reduce the life expectancy, cause early infertility or reduce the mental performance.

#### Cell Tropism
Which cell are entered and what is the effect?
* Are stem cell entered? As noted viruses mostly infect differentiated cells. However lipid enveloped particulates are taken up by stem cells too, since cell communication for differentiation mostly relies on lipid encapsulated RNA.
* What happens upon cell entry? Well sometimes the RNA is translated to proteins, is this always the case? Has the RNA other effects within the cells? Is cell death caused and if yes orderly through apoptosis?

> These are fundamental properties mandatory to estimate possible adverse effects. However nearly nothing is linked in the trials and also very few detailed experiments are published.

#### Tissue Tropism
The side effects observed for the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine hint a lymphotropism (swollen lymph nodes and herpes zooster) and neurotropism (bell's palsy, headache) for both Moderna and Pfizer.
* *Neuro-Tropism:* Neuron infections are a main cause of the dangers resulting from mumps and polio. Severe effects do not occur in the case of "mRNA" vaccines as the trials and the ongoing supervision show. However a limited death of neurones could occur: in the range from a sleepless night to one or a couple of MDMA trips ...
	> Bell's palsy then could be attributed that by chance neurones involved in the facial nerve were knocked off.
	
	> Analyzing competitive athletes could help detecting even slight performance losses.

* *Lympho-Tropism:* If the wrong lymphocytes die, a weakening of the immune system can occur: For some this may cause herpes zooster which is easy diagnosable from visible changes on the skin for others it may be something else. In theory, some cancer cells may remain undetected and cause cancer in the coming months or years.
* *Bone Marrow:* If the bone marrow is infiltrated, pluripotent stem cells can be altered or knocked off. The stem cell niches in the bone marrow are some of the best protected cells for good reason. Messing around with these stem cells niches is risky and in theory can cause many adverse effects e.g. increased aging.

> The above effects may or may not occur but predictions can only be done when ALL the cells and tissue tropism experiments are published (including the failed experiments).


### Kinetics of Adenovirus Vaccines 
Many adenoviruses can cause haemagglutination i.e. they act as glue to clump red blood cells.

> When the vaccine is now overdosed and/or not accurately administrated into the muscle, a large number of adenoviruses can be released into the bloodstream which may cause the blood cells to clump. 

> The deaths of young women observed would agree with the theory of overdosing. In the trials possibly the personal was better able to accurately administer the dose into the muscle.

> This can be prevented by 
> * weight adjusted dosage or much better 
> * using a nasal or oral spray formulation as it is done in farming for decades.
