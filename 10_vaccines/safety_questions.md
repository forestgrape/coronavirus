# Critical Assessment of Vaccine Trials and (open?) Questions

> __Rolling publication_ since young and healthy people and in some regions even children are not only allowed and motivated but often pressured to take vaccines deemed as safe. Here it is argued that the observed tolerable symptoms do *not* guarantee safety. 

> Some adverse effects are **speculative** but if healthy people are motivated or even pressured to vaccinate, in my opinion, the safety must be proven and not just be likely or unknown. Innocent people may have life-long adverse effects or even die for a supposed considerate and safe actions. // I just read yesterday (12.6.21) about a young woman who died in Italy.

> Additionally it is summer for the coming months on the Northern hemisphere and so no need to rush vaccinating the young and healthy.

> This section is partly subjective. My knowledge of adenoviruses and how transfected RNA works and what it can cause is very limited. However, I am not sure whether anybody understands RNA. RNA can do a lot. In public discussions about 'mRNA' vaccine safety, views, outdated for decades are widespread e.g. that RNA is always degraded fast and its only used to message protein-encodings:
> * RNA is always degraded fast? This is *wrong*. 
> * RNA is  just a messenger for protein translation? A few percentage true, since a tiny fraction of all RNA is indeed used to message proteins.

## Summary
Symptom watching and surveillance is usually enough for attenuated live pathogen vaccines since it is known what to except. When the symptoms are tolerable and limited the disease is not caused and so the vaccine is much than having the disease. However this method of tolerable symptoms watching is not enough to ensure the safety of other vaccines technologies. Vaccines require a thorough understanding of their behavior in the body to assess their safety by symptoms alone. Whether tolerable symptoms predict vaccine safety, depends on the technology, the exact formulation and mode of action of a vaccine:
* Even tolerable disease symptoms watching can be tricky. E.g. AIDS vaccines based on the normal AIDS virus will pass a short term tolerable symptom test and antibodies will be detected. =>  the kinetics of the pathogen is needed and for some pathogens short term watching is not enough
* For vaccines with adjuvants symptom watching is also not enough. E.g. mercury would easily pass a symptom test, however mercury can cause long term damage. Aluminum is often used even though its safety profile is surprisingly unclear. => the kinetics and behaviour of the adjuvants needs to be known.
* Transfected RNA may enter arbitrary tissues and cells: Transfection of the wrong cells such as long-lived neurones, stem cells or immune cells can have bad and life long effects. Upon transfection many things can happen e.g. cell death can be caused. So in theory adverse effects can include a loss of neurones - how many if at all is hard to say: comparable to a few hours of missing sleep or comparable to one or several MDMA (ecstasy) trips? If the bone marrow is infiltrated pluripotent stem cells can be knocked off which can in theory yield a reduced life expectancy. => For mRNA vaccines at least the tissue and cell kinetics and the exact sequence and nucleoside modification are needed.
* For adenovirus based vaccines the adenovirus species and its characterization is needed e.g. have they a haemoglutinating activity, how they distribute and when and how they are cleared. Haemoglutinating causes blood cells to clump which is possibly the cause of the observed thrombosis events.

## Introduction
There are different definitions of immunisation and vaccination around. Here a general definition is used: *Immunisation* prepares the immune system to something. *Vaccination* teaches the immune system to recognize something and thereby provide prevent disease. 


## Vaccine Trials: Why Symptom Surveillance is often NOT  enough for Safety
Early vaccines were based on live pathogens. Usually related life-forms providing cross immunity or the same pathogen but attenuated. For such vaccines the main concern is to cause the disease which is intended to be prevented and this happens from time to time. Most (but not all) diseases cause immediate symptoms and as long there are no or few symptoms there's usually no damage caused. For attenuated pathogen vaccines which cause immediate diseases, it is enough to watch for symptoms and detect whether the disease in question is caused. 
Later on one started to use adjuvants (substances increasing the immune response) for such the trials already may fail e.g. aluminum or mercury can be used and pass symptom tests (mercury is known to be harmful therefore it is not used).

### Symptom Surveillance is Enough If
Symptom surveillance is enough when one knows what to except including possible adverse effects can be predicted. All the following points should be true:
* The pathogens or substances in question  cause immediate adverse effects. E.g. many pathogens of acute diseases don't stay latent in the human body but they replicate an either growth or decrease approximately exponentially.
* The kinetics of the medication is known:
	* The distribution of the medication within the body is known.
	* It is known how, how fast and the which products the medication in question is metabolized.
	* It is known that the medication is cleared during the surveillance period.
	
### Symptom Surveillance is NOT Enough If
Symptom surveillance is only enough in the cases where the kinetics is known and such that the medication is degraded with the symptom surveillance period known and favorable. In _all other_ cases symptom surveillance is _not_ enough. Examples are:
* Substance or pathogens with a bad kinetics: 
	* Even tough low doses of mercury pass a symptom test, it enriches in the human body and can be neurotoxic. The latter is known for mercury therefore it is not used anymore as medicine.
	* The safety of aluminum as adjuvant is still unclear despite being in use for 90 year, there are studies suggesting aluminum is involved in the development of Alzheimer but such long term effects are not accessed by the trials. Nevertheless, it may be worth risking Alzheimer to avoid smallpox or polio.
	* Wild type aids viruses easily pass the symptom test. The problem is however they build their genome into long-lived immune cells and therefore AIDS infections are usually life long.
* Substances which cause subtle and hard to diagnose damage. E.g. MDMA (ecstasy) can damage neurone in the brain and cause a slight loss in mental performance. Such effects are hard to detect and not detected in simple symptom tests.
* Substance where the kinetics or the pattern of damage is unknown.

### Covid Vaccine Trials
Regarding the current mRNA and vector technologies long term and subtle health hazards are possible too. The trials only looked for symptoms and relevant data such as the tissue tropism and the exact sequences are/seem  withhold by the companies and possibly even by health authorities. Possibly for economic reasons, possibly to prevent an open discussion about side effects. 

> It is unclear whether vaccines companies spend time and resources to ensure the safety. Especially if the rumoured contracts are true which frees them from liability.

> In my opinion such contracts should be waved immediately unless the companies go open source with the entire vaccine technology stack such that an independent safety assessment is possible.


## Kinetics of the Vaccines
An important property to estimate possible effects of things is their kinetics. Kinetics denotes here, the distribution and clearance or accumulation pathways. It is a generalisation of pharmacokinetics to things: not just pharmaceutical drugs but any-thing which can distribute in the body such as pathogens which include viruses.


Some points relevant for Covid vaccines are:
* *Tissues:* To which tissues the vaccines are distributed?
	> If the vaccines reside within the deltoid muscle where administrated, possible direct effects are mostly localized there. If they vaccines are distributed systemically effects are not localized and much harder to diagnose. Also there tissues like the bone marrow or the brain where damage is not wanted.

* *Cells:* What's the cell tropism of the vaccines i.e.which cells they preferably attach and enter?

	> The cell tropism is especially needed for "mRNA vaccines" since in theory they could enter arbitrary cells and kill them. Killing or altering long lived cells can have the same effects as ageing e.g. reduce the life time, cause early infertility or reduce the intelligence. All this is not assessed in the public trials.

	> Most cells are subject to the cell turnover which means die and replaced by new ones. So these cells don't live throughout one lifetime but shorter, usually much shorter. E.g. the cells in the respiratory tract epithelium are replaced within weeks. For this reason Covid-19 unlikely causes long lasting adverse effects as long as only the respiratory tract is infected (in rare cases, mostly severe infections and when the immune system is not good, the SARS-2 viruses can spread via the blood to other organs). 
	
	
* How long the the vaccines reside within the body? 
	Knowing the decay is mandatory to know the timescales of possible side effects. 
	
	> Animal experiments or pathology of deaths temporarily associated to vaccination including full sequencing would help to bring clarity. 


### Kinetics of mRNA Vaccines
The side effects observed for the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine possibly hint some lymphotropism (swollen lymph nodes and herpes zooster) and neurotropism (bell's palsy, headache) for both Moderna and Pfizer.
* Neuron infections are a main cause of the dangers resulting from mumps and polio. Such severe effects do not occur in the case of "mRNA" vaccines as the trials and the ongoing supervision show. However a limited death of neurones could occur: in the range from a sleepless night to one or more MDMA trips ...
	> Bell's palsy then could be attributed that by chance neurones involved in the facial nerve were knocked off.
* Lympho-tropism can be bad. If the wrong lymphocytes die, an weakening of the immune system can occur: For some this may be herpes zooster which is easy diagnosable from visible changes on the skin for others it may be anything else. In theory some cancer cells may remain undetected and cause cancer in the coming months or years.

> The above effects may or may not occur but predictions can only be done when the effects on cells and the tissue tropism is published.


### Kinetics of Adenovirus Vaccines 
Many adenoviruses have haemoglutinating properties i.e. they act as glue to clump red blood cells. When the vaccine is now overdosed and/or not accurately administrated into the muscle, a large number of adenoviruses can be released into the bloodstream which may cause the blood cells to clump. 

> The deaths of young women observed would agree with this theory of overdosing. In the trials possibly the personal was more careful at administrating the vaccines.

> This can be prevented by 
> * weight adjusted dosage or much better 
> * using a nasal or oral spray formulation as it is done in farming for decades.
