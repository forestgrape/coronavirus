# Critical Assessment of Vaccine Trials and (open?) Questions

> This section is RUSHED OUT since children and young and healthy people are not only allowed but often pressured to take vaccines branded as safe. This even though just symptoms but no safety has been accessed as outline in the following. It is summer for the coming months on the Northern hemisphere, so no need for vaccine rushes against Covid.

> This section is partly subjective. My knowledge of adenoviruses and how transfected RNA works and what it can cause is very limited.

> However, to my impression nobody really understands RNA. In the public discussions of 'mRNA' vaccine safety, views, outdated for decades are widespread e.g. that RNA is always degraded fast and its only used to messenge protein-encodings. While it is true that RNA encode proteins, this is just a few percent of the RNA strands.

> I am thankful to be informed when and which of the points below are wrong or the safety regarding them is known.



## Summary
Symptom watching and surveillance is enough for attenuated live pathogen vaccines since it is known what to except. However tolerable symptoms are not enough to ensure the safety of new vaccines technologies such as transfected RNA or viral vectors. These new technologies require a thourough understanding of their behaviour in the body to assess their safety. E.g. transfected RNA may enter arbitrary tissues and cells: Transfecting long-lived neurones, stem cells or immune cells can have bad effects: Upon transfection many things can happen e.g. cell death can be caused. So in theory adverse effects can include a permanent loss of neurones, possibly comparable to an MDMA (ecstasy) trip. 
All in all tolerable symptoms is not equivalent to safety, it depends on the vaccine technology, the exact formulation and mode of action of a vaccine: 
* For adenovirus based vaccines the adenovirus species and its characterisation is needed e.g. is it haemoglutinating 

## Introduction
> There are different  [definitions of immunisation and vaccination](vaccines.md#define-vaccination) around. Here a general definition is used: *Immunisation* prepares the immune system to something. *Vaccination* teaches the immune system to recognise something and thereby provide prevent disease. 

Vaccination has a long and mostly successful history. Purposeful  vaccination dates back at least to ancient India and China with the inoculation of small pox to the skin. Here the focus is on the safety of the new technologies, namely vaccines using transfected RNA (branded as mRNA vaccines) and vaccines using different types of Adenoviruses as vectors which belong to the class of viral vector vaccines.

## Background
Vaccination once started with attenuated live pathogens. For these the main concern is, the disease to prevent is caused. Since the disease and its symptoms are usually known, the vaccines trials were designed to watch out for the symptoms (named reactogenicity). While never perfectly safe, attenuated vaccines usually are by a large margin safer than the original pathogen. 
New technologies came such as inactivated pathogen or pathogen protein vaccines but the trials design and safety assessment were largely unchanged. The new techs usually need adjuvants (some substance increasing the immune response e.g. aluminum is used). The trials in these settings are only adequate if the adjuvant safety profile is known (which is often not really the case except for short term symptoms). 
Due to the often unclear safety of the adjuvants, these new techs rather obfuscated than eliminated the risks. 
For many Covid vaccines once again new techs are used.
* The established vector based approach though experience with human was very limited and most experience was from domestic animals. Which is taking some known viruses make them expressing some SARS-2 protein (the spike is used) replication incompetent but make them replication incompetent.
* The never before used transfected RNA approach. In which a codon optimised and nucleoside modified translatable RNA is encapsulated in some lipid envelope such that cells are transfected with the RNA.  Some of the RNA then is translated like messenger RNA.

The vaccines were tested like any other vaccines constructed with established technologies: In large trials people were watched for symptoms.

## Why Symptom Surveillance is often NOT  enough for Safety
Early vaccines were based on live pathogens. Usually related life-forms providing cross immunity or the same pathogen but attenuated. For such vaccines the main concern is essentially to cause the disease which is intended to be prevented and this happens from time to time. Most (but not all) diseases cause immediate symptoms and as long there are no or few symptoms there's usually no damage caused. For attenuated pathogen vaccines which cause immediate diseases, it is enough to watch for symptoms and detect whether the disease in question is caused. 
Later on one started to use adjuvants (substances increasing the immune response) for such the trials already may fail e.g. aluminium or mercury can be used and pass symptom tests. 

### Symptom Surveillance is Enough If
Symptom surveillance is enough when one knows what to except including possible adverse effects can be predicted. All the following points should be true:
* The pathogens or substances in question  cause immediate adverse effects. E.g. many pathogens of acute diseases don't stay latent in the human body but they replicate an either growth or decrease approximately exponentially.
* The kinetics of the medication is known:
	* The distribution of the medication within the body is known.
	* It is known how, how fast and the which products the medication in question is metabolised.
	* It is known that the medication is cleared during the surveillance period.
	
### Symptom Surveillance is NOT Enough If
Symptom surveillance is only enough in the cases where the kinetics is known and such that the medication is degraded with the symptom surveillance periodknown and favorable. In ALL other cases symptom surveillance is NOT enough. Examples are:
* Substance or pathogens with a bad kinetics: 
	* Even tough low doses of mercury pass a symptom test, it enriches in the human body and can be neurotoxic. The latter is known for mercury therefore it is not used anymore as medicine.
	* The safety of aluminum as adjuvant is still unclear despite being in use for 90 year, there are studies suggesting aluminium is involved in the development of Alzheimer but such long term effects are not accessed by the trials. Nevertheless, it may be worth risking Alzheimer to avoid smallpox or polio.
	* Normal aids viruses easily pass the symptom test. The problem is however they build their proteins into long-lived immune cells and therefore AIDS infections are usually life long.
* Substances which cause subtle and hard to diagnose damage. E.g. MDMA commonly known ecstasy can damage neurone in the brain. A each heavy ecstasy trip one gets looses a little bit of mental performance. However such effects are not detected in vaccines or medicament trials.
* Substance where the kinetics or the pattern of damage is unknown.


Regarding the current mRNA and vector technologies long term and subtle health hazards are possible to. The trials only looked for symptoms and relevant data such as the tissue tropism and the exact sequences are withhold by the companies and possibly even by health authorities. Possibly for economic reasons, possibly to prevent an open discussion about side effects. So


> It is unclear whether vaccines companies spend time and resources to detect side effects or are just happy since they managed to get contracts which frees them of liability. 


## Open Topics for some of the admitted Vaccines

### Kinetics of the Vaccines
An important property to estimate possible effects of things is their kinetics. Kinetics denotes here, the distribution and clearance or accumulation pathways. It is a generalisation of pharmacokinetics to things: not just pharmaceutical drugs but anything which can distribute in the body such as pathogens which include viruses.


Some points relevant for Covid vaccines are:
* *Tissues:* To which tissues the vaccines are distributed?
	> If the vaccines reside within the deltoid muscle where they administrated, possible direct effects are mostly localised there. If they vaccines are distributed systemically effects are not localised and much harder to diagnose. Also there tissues like the bone marrow or the brain where damage is not wanted.

* *Cells:* What's the cell tropism of the vaccines i.e.which cells they preferably attach and enter?
	> Most cells are subject to the cell turnover which means die and replaced by new ones. So these cells don't live throughout one lifetime but shorter, usually much shorter. E.g. the cells in the respiratory tract epithelium are replaced within weeks. For this reason Covid-19 unlikely causes long lasting adverse effects as long as only the respiratory tract is infected (in very rare cases, namely severe infections and when the immune system is not good, the SARS-2 viruses can spread via the blood to other organs). The cell tropism is a huge concern for "mRNA vaccines" since they in theory could enter arbitrary locations and cells there and kill them. Killing long lived cells can have the same effects as ageing e.g. reduce the life time, cause early infertility or reduce the intelligence.
	
* How long the the vaccines reside within the body? 
	> Knowing the decay is mandatory to know the timescales of possible side effects. Animal experiments or pathology of deaths temporarily associated to vaccination including full sequencing would help to bring clarity. 


#### Kinetics regarding mRNA Vaccines
The side effects observed for the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine possibly hint some lymphotropism (swollen lymph nodes and herpes zooster) and neurotropism (bell's palsy). If long-lived immune or neurones are infected and possibly apoptosis is induced this is problematic:
* Neuron infections are  worrisome for viral infections and likely the main cause of the dangers resulting from mumps and polio. Such severe effects do not occur in the case of "mRNA" vaccines as the trials and the ongoing supervision show. However subtle death of neurones similar as it occurs in MDMA trips could occur. Bell's palsy then could be attributed that by chance neurones involved in the facial nerve were sent to apoptosis.
* Lymphotropism is another worry. If the wrong lymphocytes die one is at increased susceptibility to any kind of infections, for some this may be herpes zooster which is easy diagnosable from visible changes on the skin for others it may be anything else. 

#### Kinetics regarding Adenovirus Vaccines 
Many adenoviruses have haemoglutinating properties i.e. they act as glue to clump red blood cells. When the vaccine is now overdose or not accurately administrated into the muscle, a large number of adenoviruses can be released into the bloodstream which causes the blood cells to clump. 

### Covid Infection and Immune Responses in Vaccinated,  People

#### Immune Responses upon Infection
Mostly it has been published that the admitted vaccinations produces some (or a lot of) IgG. Some show that also T cells are primed. By independent research groups it is shown that most vaccines fail to produce IgA. 

However few is published about what happens upon infection. 
* Are the IgG globulins upscaled? Stay they constant because they are already high enough or the body judges them as not adequate against respiratory infections?
* Are the IgA globulins upscaled? More quickly than at SARS-2 unexposed people?  // It can be that the main protection of the vaccines results from the knowledge of the antibodies to target SARS-2 and not from the IgG levels in the blood. If that's the case much lower doses of vaccines could be sufficient - offering near the same protection at lower risks for unwanted effects.

#### Disease Progression and Pattering
How the vaccination primed immune system alters SARS-CoV-2 infections is unclear:
* Which locations are infected? Or concretely in which specimens SARS-2 RNA is detected? In NPS samples, saliva samples, endotracheal lavage fluid, bronchealveolar lavage fluid? E.g. it could be that mainly the bronchi are infected but not the alveoli. This is possible since the bronchial epithelium is less protected by IgG, but the alveolar cells are protected by IgG.
* Is the clearance faster or slower. Longer infection durations or even persistent infections are possible if the only the bronchial epithelium but not the alveolar macrophages are infected, in this case there may be no strong immune response.

Background: For vaccinated people at baseline there's much IgG but few IgA. The viruses may be mainly prevented from infecting the alveoli (which corresponds to the observations that vaccines reduce the frequency of ARDS).
