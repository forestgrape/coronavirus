# Critical Assessment of Vaccine Trials and (open?) Questions

> __RUSHED OUT__ since children and young and healthy people are not only allowed but often pressured to take vaccines deemed as safe. This even though just symptoms but not the safety has been accessed as it is outlined. Additionally it is summer for the coming months on the Northern hemisphere and so no need to rush vaccinating the young and healthy, especially since epidemiological benefits are unclear.

> Some adverse effects are **speculative** but if healthy people are motivated or even pressured to vaccinate, in my opinion, the safety must be proven and proven independently and not just be likely.

> This section is partly subjective. My knowledge of adenoviruses and how transfected RNA works and what it can cause is very limited. However, I am not sure whether anybody understands RNA. RNA can do a lot. In public discussions of 'mRNA' vaccine safety, views, outdated for decades are widespread e.g. that RNA is always degraded fast and its only used to message protein-encodings:
> * RNA is always degraded fast? This is *wrong*. 
> * Encodes proteins? Partly true, since a tiny fraction of all RNA is indeed used to encode proteins.

> I am thankful to be informed when and which of the points below are wrong or the safety regarding them is known.

## Summary
Symptom watching and surveillance and ensure tolerable symptoms is mostly enough for attenuated live pathogen vaccines since it is known what to except. However tolerable symptoms are not enough to ensure the safety of new vaccines technologies such as transfected RNA or viral vectors. These new technologies require a thorough understanding of their behavior in the body to assess their safety. E.g. transfected RNA may enter arbitrary tissues and cells: Transfection of the wrong cells such as long-lived neurones, stem cells or immune cells can have bad effects. Upon transfection many things can happen e.g. cell death can be caused. So in theory adverse effects can include a permanent loss of neurones - possibly comparable to one or several MDMA (ecstasy) trip.

Whether tolerable symptoms is equivalent to vaccine safety, depends on the technology, the exact formulation and mode of action of a vaccine:

* For adenovirus based vaccines the adenovirus species and its characterization is needed e.g. have they a haemoglutinating activity, how they distribute and when and how they are cleared.
* For mRNA vaccines the tissue and cell kinetics and the exact sequence and nucleoside modification are needed.


## Introduction
There are different definitions of immunisation and vaccination around. Here a general definition is used: *Immunisation* prepares the immune system to something. *Vaccination* teaches the immune system to recognize something and thereby provide prevent disease. 


## Vaccine Trials: Why Symptom Surveillance is often NOT  enough for Safety
Early vaccines were based on live pathogens. Usually related life-forms providing cross immunity or the same pathogen but attenuated. For such vaccines the main concern is to cause the disease which is intended to be prevented and this happens from time to time. Most (but not all) diseases cause immediate symptoms and as long there are no or few symptoms there's usually no damage caused. For attenuated pathogen vaccines which cause immediate diseases, it is enough to watch for symptoms and detect whether the disease in question is caused. 
Later on one started to use adjuvants (substances increasing the immune response) for such the trials already may fail e.g. aluminum or mercury can be used and pass symptom tests (mercury is known to be harmful therefore it is not used).

### Symptom Surveillance is Enough If
Symptom surveillance is enough when one knows what to except including possible adverse effects can be predicted. All the following points should be true:
* The pathogens or substances in question  cause immediate adverse effects. E.g. many pathogens of acute diseases don't stay latent in the human body but they replicate an either growth or decrease approximately exponentially.
* The kinetics of the medication is known:
	* The distribution of the medication within the body is known.
	* It is known how, how fast and the which products the medication in question is metabolized.
	* It is known that the medication is cleared during the surveillance period.
	
### Symptom Surveillance is NOT Enough If
Symptom surveillance is only enough in the cases where the kinetics is known and such that the medication is degraded with the symptom surveillance period known and favorable. In _all other_ cases symptom surveillance is _not_ enough. Examples are:
* Substance or pathogens with a bad kinetics: 
	* Even tough low doses of mercury pass a symptom test, it enriches in the human body and can be neurotoxic. The latter is known for mercury therefore it is not used anymore as medicine.
	* The safety of aluminum as adjuvant is still unclear despite being in use for 90 year, there are studies suggesting aluminum is involved in the development of Alzheimer but such long term effects are not accessed by the trials. Nevertheless, it may be worth risking Alzheimer to avoid smallpox or polio.
	* Wild type aids viruses easily pass the symptom test. The problem is however they build their genome into long-lived immune cells and therefore AIDS infections are usually life long.
* Substances which cause subtle and hard to diagnose damage. E.g. MDMA commonly known ecstasy can damage neurone in the brain. A each heavy ecstasy trip one gets looses a little bit of mental performance. Such effects are hard to detect and not detected in simple symptom tests.
* Substance where the kinetics or the pattern of damage is unknown.

### Covid Vaccine Trials
Regarding the current mRNA and vector technologies long term and subtle health hazards are possible to. The trials only looked for symptoms and relevant data such as the tissue tropism and the exact sequences are/seem  withhold by the companies and possibly even by health authorities. Possibly for economic reasons, possibly to prevent an open discussion about side effects. 

> It is unclear whether vaccines companies spend time and resources to ensure the safety since they are rumoured to have contracts which frees them from liability.



## Kinetics of the Vaccines
An important property to estimate possible effects of things is their kinetics. Kinetics denotes here, the distribution and clearance or accumulation pathways. It is a generalisation of pharmacokinetics to things: not just pharmaceutical drugs but anything which can distribute in the body such as pathogens which include viruses.


Some points relevant for Covid vaccines are:
* *Tissues:* To which tissues the vaccines are distributed?
	> If the vaccines reside within the deltoid muscle where administrated, possible direct effects are mostly localized there. If they vaccines are distributed systemically effects are not localized and much harder to diagnose. Also there tissues like the bone marrow or the brain where damage is not wanted.

* *Cells:* What's the cell tropism of the vaccines i.e.which cells they preferably attach and enter?

	> The cell tropism is especially needed for "mRNA vaccines" since in theory they could enter arbitrary cells and kill them. Killing or altering long lived cells can have the same effects as ageing e.g. reduce the life time, cause early infertility or reduce the intelligence. All this is not assessed in the public trials.

	> Most cells are subject to the cell turnover which means die and replaced by new ones. So these cells don't live throughout one lifetime but shorter, usually much shorter. E.g. the cells in the respiratory tract epithelium are replaced within weeks. For this reason Covid-19 unlikely causes long lasting adverse effects as long as only the respiratory tract is infected (in rare cases, mostly severe infections and when the immune system is not good, the SARS-2 viruses can spread via the blood to other organs). 
	
	
* How long the the vaccines reside within the body? 
	Knowing the decay is mandatory to know the timescales of possible side effects. 
	
	> Animal experiments or pathology of deaths temporarily associated to vaccination including full sequencing would help to bring clarity. 


### Kinetics of mRNA Vaccines
The side effects observed for the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine possibly hint some lymphotropism (swollen lymph nodes and herpes zooster) and neurotropism (bell's palsy, headache) for both Moderna and Pfizer.
* Neuron infections are a main cause of the dangers resulting from mumps and polio. Such severe effects do not occur in the case of "mRNA" vaccines as the trials and the ongoing supervision show. However a limited but noticeable death of neurones similar as it occurs in one or more MDMA trips could occur. 
	> Bell's palsy then could be attributed that by chance neurones involved in the facial nerve were knocked off.
* Lympho-tropism can be bad. If the wrong lymphocytes die, an weakening of the immune system can occur: For some this may be herpes zooster which is easy diagnosable from visible changes on the skin for others it may be anything else e.g. some cancer cells may pass undetected and yield cancer in the coming months or years.


### Kinetics of Adenovirus Vaccines 
Many adenoviruses have haemoglutinating properties i.e. they act as glue to clump red blood cells. When the vaccine is now overdosed and/or not accurately administrated into the muscle, a large number of adenoviruses can be released into the bloodstream which may cause the blood cells to clump. 

> The deaths of young women observed would agree with this theory of overdosing. In the trials possibly the personal was more careful at administrating the vaccines.

> This can be prevented by 
> * weight adjusted dosage or much better 
> * using a nasal or oral spray formulation as it is done in farming for decades.



## Covid Infection and Immune Responses in Vaccinated People

### Immune Responses upon Infection
Mostly it has been published that the admitted vaccinations produces some (or a lot of) IgG. Some show that also T cells are primed. By independent research groups it is shown that most vaccines fail to produce IgA. 

However few is published about what happens upon infection. 
* Are the IgG globulins up-scaled? Stay they constant because they are already high enough or the body judges them as not adequate against respiratory infections?
* Are the IgA globulins up-scaled? More quickly than at SARS-2 unexposed people?  // It can be that the main protection of the vaccines results from the knowledge of the antibodies to target SARS-2 and not from the IgG levels in the blood. If that's the case much lower doses of vaccines could be sufficient - offering near the same protection at lower risks for unwanted effects.

### Disease Progression and Pattering
How the vaccination primed immune system alters SARS-CoV-2 infections is unclear:
* Which locations are infected? Or concretely in which specimens SARS-2 RNA is detected? In NPS samples, saliva samples, endotracheal lavage fluid, bronchealveolar lavage fluid? E.g. it could be that mainly the bronchi are infected but not the alveoli. This is possible since the bronchial epithelium is less protected by IgG, but the alveolar cells are protected by IgG.
* Is the clearance faster or slower. Longer infection durations or even persistent infections are possible if the only the bronchial epithelium but not the alveolar macrophages are infected, in this case there may be no strong immune response.

Background: For vaccinated people at baseline there's much IgG but few IgA. The viruses may be mainly prevented from infecting the alveoli (which corresponds to the observations that vaccines reduce the frequency of ARDS).
