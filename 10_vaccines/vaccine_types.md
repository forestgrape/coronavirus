### Notes
* BT162b
* MRNA1273

## Vaccines Types

### Transfected RNA
#### RNA Encoding the Spike
##### Examples
* BT162b
* mrna1273

### Vector Based
#### Adenovirus Vector
Genetically modified adenoviruses (Chimeric Adenovirus) such that they
1. encode and express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Usually the spike is not modified except fusion stabilized.
2. do *not* replicate.

##### Examples
* AstraZeneca
* Sputnik
* Johnson&Johnson

### Inactivated Virus

### Protein Based



## Effectiveness
### Effectiveness at Preventing Disease Pattern


### Effectiveness against Variants


### Effectiveness against Strains
