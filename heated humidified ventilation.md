#### methods

Bronchial mucus transport velocity (BTV) is simply and directly assessed via fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB), and offers a visual assessment of mucociliary clearancein the lower respiratory tract. The aim of
this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the effects of heated humidified ventilation on BTV, in patients undergoing general anaesthesia.

Absolute humidity (AH) was calculated as: HumidTT 􏳷 (saturated vapour pressure at measured temperature) 􏳷 0.01.
