## Omicron

The Omicron variants seems to have features noticeable different from all previous variants:
* Different Symptoms: Rather than a typical respiratory disease, there are report for more systemic symptoms such as night sweets. Cough is still observed though.
* The transmission rate is much higher than observed for all previous variants. This is the case in different settings: household transmission, social events and populations level increase in cases. 
* The number of mutations. So fare the variants had usually below 10 mutations in the spike. Omicron has 26 mutations.
