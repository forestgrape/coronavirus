## Introduction to Coronaviruses

### Nidovirales
Coronaviruses belong to the order of Nidovirales. Nidovirales are positive single-stranded, non-segmented and enveloped RNA viruses. This means that their genetic material is encoded as a single positive strand of RNA - the same way as messenger RNA pieces of the cell. Enveloped means they have a membrane. Nido is latin for nest and describes two distinguishing features:  
* Nidovirales share a gene expression pattern in which several genes are encoded on the same RNA piece in a nested way[todo add ref lai 92]. 
* Moreover they partly shield their metabolism with nest like structures (double vesicles membrane vesicles [Lim et al 2016](#lim,liu-2016)) inside the host cell where the new virions are assembled. 

### Coronaviruses
The membrane is spherical and consists of structural proteins which are coated in a lipid bilayer membrane acquired from the host cell. This membrane is called envelope. 


#### Coronavirus Proteins  
[**in work and incomplete**]
- structural proteins: used to give newly built viruses structure. These are the membrane proteins (E, S, M, [HE]) and the internal protein N stabilizes the RNA
- diminish host defence
- RNA dependent RNA polymerase 
- cleavage other proteins and RNA [to check]

##### Spike Protein
The spike proteins point spike-like out of the spherical virions. This gives coronaviruses virions a corona (latin for crown or solar corona) like appearance under the electron microscope and therefore their name. Functions:
* RBD: The RBDs are located in the S1 part of the spike protein and binds to the ACE2 receptor. 
* [in work]


#### Coronaviruses Species
[in work]

##### SARS-CoV-1
Betacoronavirus identified causing Sars in 2003/2004.
* mainly lower respiratory tract infections
* ACE2 receptor

##### SARS-CoV-2
Betacoronavirus identified causing the current Covid-19 pandemics. A focus of this page and many sections contain special notes about features of Sars-CoV-2.

##### MERS-CoV
Betacoronavirus identified causing MERS. 
* infects cells in the deep lungs (bronchi and alveolis) 
* the natural hosts are dromedary camels
* main spreading events observed in indoor settings

##### Bovine Coronaviruses
Abbreviated BCoV. Betacoronavirus causing diarrhea and respiratory infections in cattle.



## Coronavirus Life Cycle 
As mentioned in [Introduction to Viruses](#introduction-to-viruses) viruses have a multiphase life cycle. Coronaviruses have a two phase life cycle:
* [Virion Phase](#virion-phase):[Virion](#virion) birth form and no active metabolism.
* [Metabolic Phase](#metabolic-phase): Inside a cell using the cell metabolism.


### Virion Phase
Travel and Wait for Activation.
Virions have behave similar as seeds of plants: Travel and wait for the right conditions to unleash their energy (spring loaded proteins for viruses and starch for seeds) to start the active phase.

#### Virion Travel 
Once released from a cell virions are moved by external forces ([movement-of-virions](../2_biological/life-forms.md#movement-of-virions)) until they are [activated](#tropism-virion-phase) to start the cell infection process.
A virion needs to reach possibly a host, the  location of the target cells (e.g. an organ), a specific cell and then it needs to be matched to a receptor on the cell membrane in the order of nanometers. All this without being able to move on its own and thus relying on [external movements](../2_biological/life-forms.md#movement-of-virions). The virion-target match can happen because the virion is moved to the target, the target is moved to the virion or a combination.

The infectable cell can be:
* in the same host or in another host
* in the same tissue or in another tissue
* of the same cell type or of another cell type

#### Virion Activation

Coronaviruses virions usually need to be activated before they bind to cell or initiate cell fusion. Since:
* The spike are like springs and have stored energy by which a coronavirus virion can induce cell fusion but without metabolism virions can't reload the spikes. 
* For successful infection it is important that the virions infect useful cells. 
* The targeting cell is ideally a little away from the originating cell to make targeting for the immune system more difficult.

The spikes proteins are the only part by which coronavirus virions interact with the environment, so the spike need to be activated i.e. each activation step sets a spike to a different state. 

> ##### Spike Priming
> *Spike priming* means the spike is set to a state ready for the next step in the [cell entry process](#cell-entry).


##### Plant Seeds to Virions
> Plant seeds evolved first to travel and then to be activated under favorable conditions for growth, at least as far as the seeds are able to check the conditions. Similarly virions need to be activated to initiate cell entry and thereby start the [metabolic phase](#metabolic-phase). Plants mainly need and check the right physical and chemical conditions to growth. Correspondingly seeds are activated by their physical environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light and minerals dissolved in the surrounding water to start their metabolism. Viruses need the right biological conditions inside the cells. Coronaviruses evolved to check biological conditions: receptors on cell membranes and proteases available in the environment around the cell.


#### Cell Entry
1. the virus gets attached to the matching receptor on the target cell mostly via the spike protein
2. fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes once [primed](#spike-priming): 
    * binding to a receptor on the cell membrane -> cleavage sites are exposed 
    * cleavage through proteases at specific cleavage sites enable a conformation change 
    * the conformation change push the fusion-peptides of the spike protein into the cell membrane 
    * with the fusion peptides anchored in the cell membrane a further conformation change of the spike protein presses the viral and cell membrane together which can result in membrane fusion. 
3. release and unpacking of genome and the structural proteins into the cytoplasm 
- once the viral RNA and the viral proteins are in the cytoplasm of a cell the [metabolism](#metabolic-phase) can start


### Metabolic Phase
The viral metabolism starts once the genetic material of a virion is processed by a cell and thus the virus changes the cells metabolism. This happens in a foreign cell and cells have mechanism in place to prevent its metabolism being changed i.e. keeping the metabolism immune. For that reason, each of the following steps has a noteworthy probability of failing. 

#### Metabolism Phase 1: Preparation
[in work]
The goal of the first phase in the metabolism is to produce RdRP (RNA dependent RNA Polymerase protein). Additionally let the ribosomes produce some proteins that diminish the cells immune mechanisms such that the cell doesn't ring the bells. Steps:
1. Release RNA -- let the host ribosomes translate two ORFs of the viral genome with frame-shifting---> two large proteins
2. --cleave--> pieces of proteins
3. --like magnets these pieces self arrange to structures--> 
   * proteins providing the right setting for the phase 2 metabolism e.g. prevent the cells protection mechanisms working
   * polymerase protein (protein capable of transcription of RNA to RNA) 

#### Metabolism Phase 2: Replication
The metabolism can produce new virions that are released from the cell. The properties and and the environment of the cell influence the properties of the virions produced. This phase is initiated by the transcription of the (+) strand RNA to a (-) strand RNA template mediated by the polymerase protein:
1. (+) RNA --transcription--> (-) RNA template
2. (-) RNA template -- transcription-->
   *  pieces of subgenomic mRNAs which get translated to mostly structural proteins (N, S, M, E, HE)
   *  (+) RNA genomes to get packed together with the N proteins to form the nucleocapsids of new virions and thus building up new virions.



## Tropism of Viruses

The word tropism comes from Greek 'tropos' which means turning. Correction: ~~For the movement of an organism, tropism describes the change of direction upon a stimulus. This is generalized to describe how forms of life behave under different stimuli or circumstances.~~ -> In botany tropism is used to describe when plants turn to growth in a specific direction upon a stimulus. Phototropism is when plants growth towards the sunlight and hydrotropism is when the root growth towards water. [wikipedia]

In virology tropism this is adapted to virus entities growing preferable at some locations. 

###### Tropism
> A virus *has a tropism* for an object if the objects are well support 'growth' of the virus. Specifically: 
> * Cells that support virus replication. 
> * Tissues, organs or organisms that support the growth of virus entities.

The tropism for a cell is called [Cell Tropism](#cell-tropism), [Tissue Tropism](#tissue-tropism) and [Organism or animal Tropism](#organisms-tropism).

* Virion Phase:
    Questions relevant for the tropism of viruses in the virion state:
    * To which receptors under which conditions the virions attach?
    * Factors inducing activation and cell entry of virions?
* Metabolic Phase:
    Questions relevant for the tropism of viruses in the metabolic state:
    * Do the cells support viral replication?
    * Is cell death induced upon infections?
    * Are the viruses neutralized once inside the cell?


<!--
in work ...
 Determinants for the tropism are:
* cell types:
    - receptors expressed
    - biochemistry inside the cells
* environmental factors throughout the lifetime of a virion and around the cells mainly determine entry:
    - physical environment: e.g. temperature
    - chemical environment: e.g. pH value
    - biological environment: e.g. Virions are primed for cell entry by specific proteins
    -->



### Tropism Virion Phase

As described in the section [virion activation](#virion-activation) the virions need to be activated. The activation factors determine the tropism of virions:

* Environment around the Cell
    - E.g. the spike proteins of coronaviruses needs to be primed which usually means cleaved by proteases for cell entry. This cleaving can require proteases and the right physiological conditions [citations in work]<!--[Holmes](#holmes)-->.
* Matching Receptor on the target cell surface


### Metabolic Phase Taxis
[in work: incomplete and citations/confirmation in work]

> The taxis in the virion phase is better known than the taxis in the metabolic phase. One reason is the cell entry can be investigated with reprogrammed viruses (often retroviruses) expressing the coronavirus spikes and transfected cells (mostly standard laboratory cell-lines where some genes are changed so they express the desired receptors). The transfected cell however don't need to behave similar to the cells which are naturally infected. So to investigate the metabolic phase,  To investigate the metabolic phase, ideally one could look into the cells.

#### Cell Tropism
* The cell environment shouldn't deactivate the virus or alarming the immune system.
* The cell should be able to produce many virions and thus should have a capable metabolism.
  

### Taxes in Cells

##### Taxis in Cells
> *Cell taxis* is used on this page to describe how a virus behaves upon match of a virion to a specific cell type i.e. the behavior in specific cells.

The cell taxis is the combination of the [virion behavior](#tropism-virion-phase) which determines whether a cell infection takes place and the [taxis in the metabolic phase](#taxis-metabolic-phase) which determines the changes in the cells metabolism induced upon infection.

#### Coronavirus Taxis for Cells
[in work]
* Ciliated epithelia and secretory cells support well replication of coronaviruses both cells located in the airway and the intestine
* Immune system cells are infected but usually cell death is induced in the early phase of the viral metabolism and before replication takes place.

Viruses optimized to their environment usually only infect cells involved in the survival of the virus strain:
* Cells used as entry point. For coronaviruses these are often cells on the epithelial layer of respiratory tract.
* Cells that support efficient virus replications takes place and virions easily reach the next cells to build up a population. For betacoronaviruses these are similar the entry cells i.e. secretory and ciliated cells in the epithelium of the respiratory tract.
* Cells relevant to leave a host. These vary for the different coronavirus species and the hosts infected.
    - Coronaviruses entities infecting outdoor living hosts, usually leave the hosts by feces. So cells in the intestine are infected.
    - For indoor living hosts (us humans and our domestic animals) these are often the same cells as entered i.e. cells in the respiratory tract.
* Cells which are relevant for the host immune response. Coronaviruses infect immune system cells (dendritic and T cells) and induce aptosis.


###### Tissue Taxis
> *Tissue taxis* denotes how a virus infection behaves in a specific tissues.



### Tissue Tropisms

###### Tissue Tropism 
> *Tissue tropism* describes whether a virus entity growths well in a certain tissue.

Coronaviruses replicate well in the respiratory tract, thus they have a tropism for the respiratory tract.

The tissue tropism depends on:
* Susceptible Cells in the tissue
* Movement within the tissue i.e. reaching the next cell in the tissue
  * Coronaviruses usually infect the apical cell layer of the respiratory tract epithelium initially. Most [virions are released](#apical-side-preference) again on the apical side to spread via the covering fluids. Some virions are released on the basal layer and can yield further infections deeper in the tissue or spread via the blood stream, especially if released from the intestine from where they can leave and infect the next host. 
  * Coronaviruses are to big to diffuse efficiently inside most tissues.
* Immune defenses present locally in the tissue.


#### Tropism for the Apical Side
*  The transmission pathways of human coronaviruses (mostly airborne and vector-less) yield an initial deposition of the virions on the apical side together with the barrier function of the epithelial cell layer, the virions come mostly in contact with the apical sides of cells.
* In vitro [cell culture to check] experiments from [McCray & Co](#mccray05) show both increased apical ACE2 expression and a corresponding increased cell entry from the apical side. [McCray & Co](#mccray05) also observed in the lab that Sars-CoV-1 exits the cell on the apical side following an apical entry with a preference of more than 1000:1. Similar observations for the coronavirus 229E: It infects the cells, corresponding to its receptor (amino-peptidase N) expression, preferably from the apical surface [[McCray](#mccray)]. 229E exits apically with a preference of 10:1 (about 91%) for an apical entry and 5:1 (about 83%) for a basal entry.    



### Taxes for Cells of Sars-Cov-2
[in work]
* efficient replication
    - alveolar type 2 cells
    - alveolar macrophages
* infection but no replication
    - dendritic cells [check: if ACE2 expressed/other mechanism of phagocytosis]: aptosis induce
* no entry
    - Cells not expressing ACE2. Except if the cells phagocyte virions on their own and the virions are able to fuse the membranes once phagocyted (usually captured in an endosome). 
    E.g. antibody marked virions can get phagocyted by macrophages. 
    
        > This is both relevant upon reinfection and for the design of vaccines. Antibodies against the outer membrane proteins (e.g. the spike) can be a two-sided sword.


#### SARS-2 Cell Entry
The cell entry receptor used by SARS-CoV-1 [[Jiang](#jiang)] and SARS-Cov-2 [[LiF](#lif)],[[Hoffmann](#hoffmann)] is ACE2.


### Habitat of Sars-CoV-2
[in rework to remove errata and to clarify]
The task determine to habitat of Sars-CoV-2 can be tackled either 
* a [theoretical deduction](#theoretical-deduction) based on the cell taxis and tropism, ability to reach new infectable cells within the tissue and the immune surveillance in place. The cell taxis and tropism in turn are based on in vivo and in vitro experiments and observations.
* an [empirical deduction](#empirical-deduction) based on observations of Covid-19 cases. E.g. determine the viral load which corrected for the movement of virions corresponds to the infection locations.


#### Theoretical Deduction
In the following the [tissue habitat](#tissue-habitat) of Sars-CoV-2 is deduced from the [cell tropism](#cell-tropism-of-sars-cov-2) and the reachability of the tissue in question.

#### Empirical Deduction
[in rework: update and a section for each strain]
The [viral loads](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) measured in combination with the [movements of virions](#movement-of-virions) inside the body can be used to backtrack tissue habitats of Sars-CoV-2. 
[in work]
* In the chapter [disease pattering](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) it is described that coronaviruses infect different location throughout the respiratory tract.
* The viral loads observed for SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostic purposes are described in the chapter [Diagnosis and Viral Load](./../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md).




#### Interspecies Infections of Coronaviruses
* all occurrences where [interspecies jumps](#interspecies-jump) occurred at least one [interspecies infection](#interspecies-infection) must have occurred. But it is likely that many interspecies infections occurred before the jump happened. 
* Infections of Humans:
    - In the 70s and 80s there were a couple of reports that BCoV regularly causes infections in the human intestines. Most of them are based on EM images and serological evidence. However, since most groups couldn't cultivate the viruses and there's some doubt [citations on the way]. 
    - The HECV-4408 coronavirus was isolated from a child having diarrhea [Zhang et al](../5_epidemiological/reduce_covid_bovine_farming.md#zhang-94)
    - Using RNA sequence data and evolution-models [Dudas et al](../2_biological/hypotheses_nidovirales.md#summary-dudas-2017) conclude that there are likely hundred of infections per year from camel to humans. 
#### Observed Interspecies Jumps
* jumps: Bovine coronaviruses have jumped to a whole range of hosts: canine, human, wild ruminants, porcine [Bidokhti et al](#bidokhti).
* jumps to humans, also called [zoonosis](#zoonosis): MERS, Sars-CoV-1 and OC43 are all jumped from animals to humans [refs in work]. 



## Evolution and Adaption
[in work]

Coronaviruses can adapt fast to changed or new environments if given time and opportunity. The adaption over multiple generations occurs through genetic evolution i.e. mutation of RNA genome. 
The genetic evolution of coronaviruses is fast compared to other [forms of life](#life-form) because:
* a short average generation-time (only a few hours [to be confirmed]) 
* properties of [single stranded RNA replication](#ssRNA). The mechanism of RNA copying is: 
    - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which yields a high rate of random point mutations compared to DNA polymerases
    - a homologous recombination mechanism [[Woo et al.](#woo)] , more refs coming]
* Genome is [encoded in RNA and not in DNA](#lifetime-storage) 
* large population size both within hosts and the number of infected hosts (for Sars-CoV-2)

Coronaviruses have large genomes (in comparison to other RNA viruses or messenger RNAs) which both back the recombination and encode complex proteins. The coronavirus RNA genome is among the largest strands of RNA occurring on todays earth, possibly even the largest [to check].  
[in work]

### Conserved Patterns
[in work]
Some parts of the coronavirus genome 
* Functional units of proteins. The more fundamental there function is, the more conserved they tend to be.
* Internal proteins of viruses are more difficult to target for the immune system, therefore the corresponding genes have less evolutionary drive to adapt.
* For coronaviruses, the replication mechanism is well conserved and thus the proteins involved.

Examples of well conserved proteins for coronaviruses are:
* RNA viruses need to duplicate their RNA for replication, which requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein. This protein is well conserved [to check, citation coming]. 
* The coronavirus RNA is packaged with the help of a nucleocapsid protein, usually denoted by N.

## Appendix

### ACE2 Receptor
#### ACE2 Receptor Detection
There are two common methods to measure tissue distribution of proteins:
* ##### Antibody Staining
    Proteins on cell surfaces can be visualized by using marked antibodies. Several groups have analyzed tissues with ACE2 antibodies: [Timens](#timens), [McCray](#mccray05), [soilleux, poehlmann](#soilleux,poehlmann)
* ##### Measure mRNA
    Measure ACE2 [mRNA](#mrna) expression. Necessary condition for a cell to produce a protein. However not sufficient for ACE2 on apical cell surface [to confirm]. The mRNA expression across the human body is shown in  [Li et al](#li).

##### Challenges for ACE2 Detection
[in work, verification needed]
For serving as an entry point, ACE2 needs to be built into the cell membrane as a receptor i.e. being useable from the outside. 

Since coronaviruses have a preference for [apical tissue sites](#tissue-tropism) ACE2 should be expressed on the apical sites. 
* [Antibody staining](antibody-staining) alone can yield false positives if the cells are not properly cleaned and ACE2 is just attached to the cell without being built into the cell membrane. 
* [Measuring mRNA](#measure-mrna) just detects if the cells produces ace2. But proteins produced by a cell can  
    - stay in the cell e.g. in the cytoplasm or move into the nucleus
    - be released from the cell
    - being built into the cell membrane on the basal side or on the apical side as a receptor <= needed by coronaviruses. 

Receptor detection rules:
* If _both_ [receptor detection methods](#ace2-receptor-detection) yield true, this is very likely. 
* Antibody staining is likely enough if the 'receptor molecule' cannot be attached on the outside of a cell or if it can be cleaned away.
* Measuring mRNA is enough if the 'receptor' is always exposed on the cell membrane if produced and thus not reside intracellular.

#### ACE2 Receptor Distribution
[**incomplete and in rework**]
[recommended read is [soilleux, poehlmann 2012](#soilleux,poehlmann) where ACE2 receptor distribution obtained from tissue staining is described]
ACE2 is apically available 
* in the lower respiratory tract
    - well-differentiated and ciliated airway epithelia [[mcray05](#mccray05)] 
    - alveolar epithelial type 2 cells [to check/find citation].
* in the upper respiratory tract
    - the basal layer of the non-keratinised squamous epithelium of the nasal, oral mucosa and the nasopharynx expresses ACE2 [Timens](#timens), [Lau](#lau) [in rework]. 
    - goblet cells [in work]
