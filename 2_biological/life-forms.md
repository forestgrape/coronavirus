## Summary
First things first: life forms on earth. A life-forms has memorized environment interactions, called genetic information, and is able to produce rough copies of itself, called progeny. The genetic information is stored in different single or double chains of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Life-forms differ in the way the interact with each other: some are more self contained and some less. The interactions determine to a large part how life forms are built and shield their metabolism.


## Introduction to Life on Earth

> ###### Life Form
> A *life form* in a given environment is an identifiable thing that can interact and influence parts of its environment and thereby produce things which are near the same and accordingly have near the same interaction patterns. These are called *progeny* or *next generation*.

In other words, a form of live has memorized environment interactions and passes rough copies of those memories to the next generation.

All known forms of life on earth use enzymes made of RNA and/or proteins to steer biochemical reactions.

###### Enzyme
> An organic substance made from proteins and/or RNA, which catalyzes reactions in watery solutions.

The simplest forms of life are viroids.

> ###### Viroid
> *Viroids* are pieces of RNA able to replicate.

All other known forms of life also encode enzymes made of proteins.

> ###### Protein
> *Proteins* are amino acids chained together.

Proteins are assembled by ribosomes:

> ###### Ribosome
> ###### mRNA
> ###### Translation
> *Ribosomes* read positive sense RNA, called *messenger RNA* or just *mRNA*, and select a amino acid for each triple of RNA acids and chain these amino acids together to proteins. This process is called *translation* since the mRNA is translated to a protein.

The storage piece encoding mRNA making up a functional protein or a functional RNA is called a gene:

> ###### Gene
> A *gene* denotes a piece of storage encoding a functional polypeptide or RNA strand.

Genes are sequences of single/double stranded DNA or RNA which are transcribed to positive stranded RNA, which in turn can get translated by ribosomes to proteins.



## Memorizing Interactions

### Storage Options
[in work] Life forms have to ability to memorize environment interactions. Four kinds of lifetime storage are known to be used on todays earth.

* ##### ssRNA
    single stranded RNA:
    - unstable
    - difficult to reliably duplicate, recombination possible
* ##### dsRNA
    double stranded RNA:
    - somewhat unstable
    - somewhat reliable duplication possible
* ##### ssDNA
    single stranded DNA:
    - difficult to reliable duplicate, recombination possible
    - mediocre stability
* ##### dsDNA
    double stranded DNA:
    - very stable
    - reliable duplication possible

#### Notes on Storage
* only dsDNA forms are able to encode all enzymes for their entire metabolism and are able do photosynthesis on todays earth. All other life forms are dependent on some enzymes produced by dsDNA forms and are called [viruses](../2_biological/viruses.md#virus).
* Some forms of life alternate the storage formats through their life cycle: ssRNA-RT (retroviruses).
 

### Storage Reading
[in work]

#### 1 Form using RNA only

* uRNA = untranslated RNA 
  * single RNA strand which catalyzes its duplication
  * only occurs in [Viroids](#viroid) [to check].

#### 7 Forms using Proteins
7 forms of combinations of lifetime storage and duplication/decode mechanisms are known to be in use on earth, known as Baltimore classification:
* (+)ssRNA = Single stranded RNA, + sense
    - genome can be directly read by ribosomes
    - replication is done via a (-) RNA strand which is duplicated to many (+) strands
* (-)ssRNA = Single stranded RNA, - sense
    - genome needs to be transcribed to (+) stranded RNA before translation in the ribosomes
    - replication is done via  (+) stranded RNA
* ssDNA = Single-strand DNA
* dsDNA-RT = gapped DNA
* dsRNA = Double strand RNA
* ssRNA-RT = DNA-RNA reverse transcribing
* dsDNA = Double stranded DNA (all cellular life forms)

### How Life Forms Respond and Behave depending on Situations

#### Mechanism for Specific Behavior
Organisms behave different in different environmental situations.
The different behaviors can be driven by:
* Lifetime acquired knowledge. 
* Inherited behavior and responses, stored in the genome. 
* Extern stimulus induced a certain behavior which the life form itself cannot/does not control. E.g. certain physical or chemical stimulus.

Storage form of behavior and responses:
* Stored in neural nets. This is usually the case for lifetime acquired behavior in animals.
* Genetically stored behavior i.e. hard coded in the genome.

 
#### Responses to Stimuli
> section in work and changes likely

> ##### Taxis
> *Taxis* denotes directed movement in response to a stimulus.

> ##### Kinesis
> *Kinesis* denotes undirected movement in response to a stimulus.


### How Life Forms Growth
Plants adapt the environment by different growing patterns.

##### Tropism
> *Tropism* denotes here how organisms growth subject to environmental influences. When a life form growths preferable in some settings, the life life form has a tropism for that setting.

> Generalized here from the usages in virology and botany, given below.

In botany, tropism is used how plants growth subject to stimuli. 
Examples: 
* When a plant growths towards light this is called phototropism. 
* When roots of a plants growth towards water it is hydrotropism.

In virology, tropism is used to describe locations where viruses usually are. Described in the chapter [viruses](./viruses.md#tropism).
Examples:
* Coronaviruses replicate well in the respiratory tract, thus coronaviruses have a tropism for the respiratory tract.
* SARS-CoV-2 infects type 1 pneumocytes cells, thus SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for these cells.



## Ecology 


### Interactions between Life Forms
Nearly all forms of life are dependent on other forms of life in one way or another. Mostly they need substances for their metabolism which are only produced by other forms of life:
* All forms of life except those who are able to do photosynthesis or use other inorganic energy sources (thermal, chemical) are dependent on organic energy sources i.e. forms of energy produced by other forms of life.
* Besides energy, mammals - including us humans - also need extern sources for vitamins, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, ...

Cell forming forms usually just need the ingredients (raw materials) and are able to produce the enzymes (machines). Where as [viruses](../2_biological/viruses.md#virus) by definition don't produce all needed enzymes (machines).

Many forms of life live in symbiotic relations with many other forms of life: each form providing what it is best at providing at. Many interactions between life forms turned out to be beneficial and some of these even evolved into permanent couplings. Sometimes the couplings are so strong that the combination is a new form of life: E.g. mitochondria as cell organelles.


### Mechanism to Control Interactions
Most life forms have have some mechanisms to keep their metabolism immune i.e. reducing interactions and thus making it more self contained and controllable. These mechanisms are called [immune system](../4_immunological/immune_system.md). A simple and effective way of doing so, is shielding the metabolism by (semipermeable) membranes. The membranes evolved vary in permeability, thickness and rigidity.

## Life-Forms by Structure and Interactions

### Cell Forming Life Forms
**[in work]**
As noted all forms of life which encode their entire metabolism are dsDNA based. Many [to check if all] of these forms have their metabolism inside semipermeable membranes [to check: all double layer lipid?]. Such a structure is called a cell. Some cells have just the outer membrane:

> ##### Prokaryotes
> Life forms having an outer membrane but no inner membrane shielding the genome away from the main metabolism. These forms are called *prokaryotes* (from Greek: pro=before, karyo=kernel).

Some cells are subdivided again by membranes into different compartments which are called cell organelles. If the genome is shielded by a kernel genome is shielded by a membrane this organelle is called nucleus. 

> ##### Eukaryotes
> Cell forming life forms shielding their genome by an inner membrane are called *eukaryotes* (naming done in the 60's eukaryote = with-a-well-formed-kernel; eu=well and karyo=kernel). This inner structure is called nucleus.


* Prokaryotes
  - Eubacteria
    * Cyanobacteria 
    * Bacteria
  - Archaea
* Eukaryotes
  * Plants, Animals and Fungi all belong to the eukaryotes. These eukaryotes form multicellular organisms. 
  * There are many more eukaryotes, many of them not forming multicellular organisms and thus living as single cells. Even though very divers, these are called *protozoa*. 

Often life forms specialize, organize and work together to form a more capable entity and thus the overall fitness is increased. TExamples of cooperations are symbiosis and organisms. 

<!-- Symbiosis life forms keep independence for replication or can life Inside an organism the units communicate and share resources. Sometime the units keep some independence and can go separate paths again. However many forms of life on todays earth e.g. plants, fungi and animals, are organisms:
-->

> ###### Organism
> Start out as a single cell with replicates. At some point the replicates differentiate into specialized cells having different appearances and tasks. 

For many questions, organisms are considered as a whole and not the single cells. E.g. we usually are more interested in how fast an organism moves forward/runs and not how fast some single muscle cell contracts.


### Viruses
Viruses are life-forms which don't encode and can't produce all the proteins required for their metabolism. Discussed on the [viruses page](../2_biological/viruses.md).
