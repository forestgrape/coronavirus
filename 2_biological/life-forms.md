## Summary
First things first: life forms on earth. A life-forms has memorized environment interactions and is able to produce rough copies of itself, called progeny. Viruses are defined as life forms which can't produce all enzymes required for their metabolism. Aspects such as life cycle and movement of viruses are sketched. 

## Introduction to Life

### Life Forms

> ###### Life Form
> A *life form* in a given environment is an identifiable thing that can interact and influence parts of its environment and thereby produce things which are near the same and accordingly have near the same interaction patterns. These are called *progeny* or *next generation*.

In other words, a form of live has memorized environment interactions and passes rough copies of those memories to the next generation.

All known forms of life on earth use enzymes made of RNA and/or proteins to steer biochemical reactions.

###### Enzyme
> An organic substance made from proteins and/or RNA, which catalyzes reactions in watery solutions.

The simplest forms of life are viroids.

> ###### Viroid
> *Viroids* are pieces of RNA able to replicate.

All other known forms of life also encode enzymes made of proteins.

> ###### Protein
> *Proteins* are amino acids chained together.

Proteins are assembled by ribosomes:

> ###### Ribosome
> ###### mRNA
> ###### Translation
> *Ribosomes* read positive sense RNA, called *messenger RNA* or just *mRNA*, and select a amino acid for each triple of RNA acids and chain these amino acids together to proteins. This process is called *translation* since the mRNA is translated to a protein.

The storage piece encoding mRNA making up a functional protein or a functional RNA is called a gene:

> ###### Gene
> A *gene* denotes a piece of storage encoding a functional polypeptide or RNA strand.

Genes are sequences of single/double stranded DNA or RNA which are transcribed to positive stranded RNA, which in turn can get translated by ribosomes to proteins.


### Lifetime Storage
[in work] Life forms have to ability to memorize environment interactions. Four kinds of lifetime storage are known to be used on todays earth.

* ##### ssRNA
    single stranded RNA:
    - unstable
    - difficult to reliably duplicate, recombination possible
* ##### dsRNA
    double stranded RNA:
    - somewhat unstable
    - somewhat reliable duplication possible
* ##### ssDNA
    single stranded DNA:
    - difficult to reliable duplicate, recombination possible
    - mediocre stability
* ##### dsDNA
    double stranded DNA:
    - very stable
    - reliable duplication possible

#### Notes on Storage
* only dsDNA forms are able to encode all enzymes for their entire metabolism and are able do photosynthesis on todays earth. All other life forms are dependent on some enzymes produced by dsDNA forms and are called [viruses](#virus).
* Some forms of life alternate the storage formats through their life cycle: ssRNA-RT (retroviruses).
 

### Storage and Duplication Options
[in work]

#### 1 Form using RNA only

* uRNA = untranslated RNA 
  * single RNA strand which catalyzes its duplication
  * only occurs in [Viroids](#viroid) [to check].

#### 7 Forms using Proteins
7 forms of combinations of lifetime storage and duplication/decode mechanisms are known to be in use on earth, known as Baltimore classification:
* (+)ssRNA = Single stranded RNA, + sense
    - genome can be directly read by ribosomes
    - replication is done via a (-) RNA strand which is duplicated to many (+) strands
* (-)ssRNA = Single stranded RNA, - sense
    - genome needs to be transcribed to (+) stranded RNA before translation in the ribosomes
    - replication is done via  (+) stranded RNA
* ssDNA = Single-strand DNA
* dsDNA-RT = gapped DNA
* dsRNA = Double strand RNA
* ssRNA-RT = DNA-RNA reverse transcribing
* dsDNA = Double stranded DNA (all cellular life forms)


### Interactions between Life Forms
Nearly all forms of life are dependent on other forms of life in one way or another. Mostly they need substances for their metabolism which are only produced by other forms of life:
* All forms of life except those who are able to do photosynthesis or use other inorganic energy sources (thermal, chemical) are dependent on organic energy sources i.e. forms of energy produced by other forms of life.
* Besides energy, mammals - including us humans - also need extern sources for vitamins, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, ...

Cell forming forms usually just need the ingredients (raw materials) and are able to produce the enzymes (machines). Where as [viruses](#virus) by definition don't produce all needed enzymes (machines).

Many forms of life live in symbiotic relations with many other forms of life: each form providing what it is best at providing at. Many interactions between life forms turned out to be beneficial and some of these even evolved into permanent couplings. Sometimes the couplings are so strong that the combination is a new form of life: E.g. mitochondria as cell organelles.



### Keeping the Metabolism Immune
Most life forms have have some mechanisms to keep their metabolism immune i.e. reducing interactions and thus making it more self contained and controllable. These mechanisms are called [immune system](../4_immunological/immune_system.md). A simple and effective way of doing so, is shielding the metabolism by (semipermeable) membranes. The membranes evolved vary in permeability, thickness and rigidity.

#### Cell Forming Life Forms
**[in work]**
As noted all forms of life which encode their entire metabolism are dsDNA based. Many [to check if all] of these forms have their metabolism inside semipermeable membranes [to check: all double layer lipid?]. Such a structure is called a cell. Some cells have just the outer membrane:

> ##### Prokaryotes
> Life forms having an outer membrane but no inner membrane shielding the genome away from the main metabolism. These forms are called *prokaryotes* (from Greek: pro=before, karyo=kernel).

Some cells are subdivided again by membranes into different compartments which are called cell organelles. If the genome is shielded by a kernel genome is shielded by a membrane this organelle is called nucleus. 

> ##### Eukaryotes
> Cell forming life forms shielding their genome by an inner membrane are called *eukaryotes* (naming done in the 60's eukaryote = with-a-well-formed-kernel; eu=well and karyo=kernel). This inner structure is called nucleus.


* Prokaryotes
  - Eubacteria
    * Cyanobacteria 
    * Bacteria
  - Archaea
* Eukaryotes
  * Plants, Animals and Fungi all belong to the eukaryotes. These eukaryotes form multicellular organisms. 
  * There are many more eukaryotes, many of them not forming multicellular organisms and thus living as single cells. Even though very divers, these are called *protozoa*. 

Often life forms specialize, organize and work together to form a more capable entity and thus the overall fitness is increased. TExamples of cooperations are symbiosis and organisms. 

<!-- Symbiosis life forms keep independence for replication or can life Inside an organism the units communicate and share resources. Sometime the units keep some independence and can go separate paths again. However many forms of life on todays earth e.g. plants, fungi and animals, are organisms:
-->

> ###### Organism
> Start out as a single cell with replicates. At some point the replicates differentiate into specialized cells having different appearances and tasks. 

For many questions, organisms are considered as a whole and not the single cells. E.g. we usually are more interested in how fast an organism moves forward/runs and not how fast some single muscle cell contracts.



## Introduction to Viruses

> ###### Virus
> A *virus* is a form of life, that encodes and has proteins produced but can't produce all necessary enzymes for its metabolism on its own.

* That it encodes and produces proteins distinguishes viruses from [viroids](#viroid).
* That a virus cannot produces all the required enzymes distinguishes them from more self contained forms of life such as eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
* The definition of a virus is by that specific behavior alone (not able to produce all enzymes for its metabolism). Apart from this specific property viruses are very divers. From a molecular viewpoint as diverse as life itself.
  
Viruses integrate enzymes produced by other forms of life into their metabolism. Since all life forms which are enzymatically independent life forms on today's earth are [cell based](#cell-forming-life-forms) [to check] and the metabolisms is inside the cells, viruses need to be within cells to replicate.

> ###### Infected Cell
> A cell is called *infected* by a virus if it contains genetic material of the virus which influences the cell's metabolism.

> ###### Infected Object
> An object is *infected* if it contains [infected cells](#infected-cell). An object can be a tissue, an organ, a structure (e.g. upper respiratory tract) or an organism.

These can mean that the virus is replicating inside the cell. A cell is also called infected if only some viral genes are translated and the resulting enzymes are active and thus influence the cells metabolism. To specify, cells in which replication takes place are called host cells.

> ###### Host Cell
> A *host cell* is a cell in which a virus replicates. 

So a host cell is always an infected cell. 

Most cells don't live forever. In multicellular organisms most cells live fare shorter than the organism itself and even most cell lines don't survive and only few cells have the chance of being part of the cells giving raise to descendants [Organisms](#). If virus infected, cells often die even faster. Thus viruses need to jump to next cells. To achieve this, most viruses, including coronaviruses, have a 2 phase life cycle.

### Life Cycles of Viruses
Different viruses have different life cycles:
* 1 Phase Life Cycle: Some viruses live always within cells and accordingly are only transmitted vertically and not horizontally [to confirm and cite].
* 2 Phase Life Cycle: Most viruses including coronaviruses, have a two phase life cycle.
    Coronaviruses have a two phase life cycle:
    1. Virion phase: They are born/produced as [virion](#virion). Virions are similar to seeds of plants in the sense they have no metabolism: [passive travel](#virion-travel), wait to be [activated](#virion-activation) by matched with an [infectable cell](#infectable-cell) in the right environment. Once activated virions try to enter the cell.
    2. Metabolic phase: Once inside a cell, a virus uses the cells metabolism to produce proteins and other substances using the structures, ribosomes, enzymes and resources (fatty acids, amino acids and ribonucleic acids) from the host cell. As for all forms of life the ultimate goal is to produce progeny = new virions.
* 4 Phase life cycle: Retroviruses have a four 4 phase cycle [to confirm and cite]:
  1. Sleeping Phase A: Virion Phase (corresponds the virion phase of 2-phase viruses).
  2. Metabolic Phase A: In the metabolic phase A the virion build their genome into the host cells genome.
  3. Sleeping Phase B: The virus genome is part of the host cell DNA.
  4. Metabolic Phase B: The virus genome is transcribed to RNA from the host cells genome. The virus RNA is translated to new virions (corresponds the metabolic phase of 2-phase viruses).


> ###### Virion
> A *virion* is the 'birth-form' of a virus. The genome and proteins required to infect a cell are usually packed into some form of protective shell. A virion has no active metabolism.

Viruses while outside of cells are present as virions. Virions are passively [moved around](#movement-of-virions). Most virions decay but some get matched to an infectable cell. On match [infect cells](#infected-cell) and transform to the [metabolic phase](#metabolic-phase).

> Virions are [similar to seeds of plants](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#plant-seeds-to-virions): They are dormant and wait for activation. Virions don't have a metabolism running. They evolved to induce infection on the right circumstances. Once activated/primed cell fusion is initiated by using spring loaded energy stored in the structure of special proteins.

Once a virus infects cells, it changes metabolism of the cell.


> ###### Virus Infection
> An object is called *infected* by a virus if it contains cells that are infected. An object can be a tissue, an organ, a structure or an [organism](#organism).

So an organism is infected if it has some [cells that are infected](#infected-cell).

> ###### Infectable Cell
> A *infectable cell* is a cell which can be [infected](#infected-cell). There are [constraints on a cell](#cell-tropism) to be infectable.

> ###### Infectable Object
> An object is *infectable* if can become [infected](#infected-object). Necessary conditions are (1) [infectable cells](#infectable-cell) and this cell must also be reachable. An object can be a tissue, an organ, a structure (e.g. upper respiratory tract) or an organism.

> ##### Infectable Organism
> An *infectable organism* is an [infectable object](#infectable-object) where the object is an organism.

There are [constraints on a object to be infectable](#tropism-of-viruses). A necessary condition for an object to become infected is the availability of [infectable cells](#infectable-cell). However this condition is not sufficient, reachability, priming factors and immune evasion are other conditions needed.

Therefore viruses are dependent on the host cells. Long-term surviving virus strains generally have a symbiotic relationship with their natural host life form as a whole but still can be fatal for individuals. The survival of fit ecosystems is ubiquitous in nature.


### Virus Classification
By definition, a [virus](#virus) is a [life form](#life-form) encoding proteins but not all. This definition is very broad so often further classifications/grouping are done. 

> The goal of classification is usually to group things together which are similar to some properties or behavior of interest. 

Features of interest for viruses are:
* Viruses can be classified by the hosts they infect. E.g. bacteriophages infect bacteria.
* Genetic and metabolic similarity. Viruses exists across all the [different storage forms](#storage-and-duplication-options) used by life forms.
* Structural Similarity. E.g. viruses can be classified into enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.


### Virus Entities
[in work and experimental]

Similarly for viruses infecting organisms, often to grasp the full picture it is necessary to consider all viruses as an entity and not as unrelated. Viruses can show different behaviors in different cells and upon different situations:
* DNA viruses can in theory encode the same differentiation mechanisms as eukaryotic cells 
* RNA viruses don't encode the same mechanisms as DNA based forms of life e.g. for gene expression. However they still are able to show [different behaviors](#tropism-of-viruses) in different situations. 

> ###### Virus Entity
> A *Virus Entity or Virus Organism* denotes all viruses in an organism resulting from a single infection occurrence. Upon a new infection the infections can interact and give rise to a *new entity*.

Similar to the different cells in multicellular organism only few viruses in a virus entity are likely to infect new hosts and thereby form a new entity.

> Virus entities/organisms are a concept I haven't seen about in literature. Similar concepts may exists possibly under different names.

<!--
#### life cycle of a coronavirus entity
[in rework in ideas to explore section]
In outdoors living vertebrate hosts, the infection course of a coronavirus entity is likely [citations and argumentation in work]:
* enter the respiratory system
* spread throughout respiratory tract and replicate to high numbers (often in ciliated epithelial cells) 
* [diminish parts of the host immune system]
* reach the intestine (or sometimes the kidney) by spreading through blood or through the alimentary tract via stomach
* establish a possibly longer lasting infection in the intestine(/kidney) and continuously have progeny released
* progeny: the virions get transported by wind or water to new susceptible hosts
-->


### Movement of Virions
Once virions are released from a cell the virions are moved by whatever movements are in their surroundings.   

#### Swim with the Tide
All forms of life on earth are water based. Both protein and RNA/DNA synthesis occur in water. So virions are pro therefore start out their journey in watery fluids, often the cytoplasm of a cell. Upon release they are exposed to whatever substances there are around. For most viruses their virions will always be dissolved in watery fluids and will not survive being dissolved in other fluids such as alcohol or air. 
* __Fluid dissolved in__:
    - Salty water in oceans: Water in the oceans is also likely where life and RNA viruses as an early form of life developed and still contains a huge number of virions. 
    - Water in lakes and rivers: These waters serve as an intermediate place for many virions. 
    - Fluid in an organism: Virions of viruses infecting multicellular life first start out in the fluids of the hosts and in many cases never leave the host fluids. 
    - Water droplets can be dissolved in air. 
    - Air is challenging to use for viruses due to dilution and activation factors such as sunlight, washed out by rain ... 
* __Material attached to__: These can be any solid material e.g. a part of living organism or any kind of non living matter. The movement of virions follows the movement of the materials attached to. These particles are in turn dissolved in fluids, mostly water, or attached to other particles. 


#### Movement within a Host
Often virions get moved within a host. Some even evolved not to leave the host organism at all. Within a host the movement of virions depends on the location they are released and the kind of material they are attached to: 
- movements with fluid flows:
    * the blood flow if the virion is in the bloodstream
    * the mucus flow 
    * respiratory tract lining fluid
    * the air breathed in and out and the [particle dynamics in the respiratory tract](./../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#particle-dynamics-in-the-respiratory-tract) associated.
- solid movements within the host i.e. the virion is attached to a moveable part:
    * inside cells by the centrosome. Especially important for viruses which need to enter the cell nucleus e.g. influenza viruses.
    * attached to particles get moved around within a host. 
    * the movement of body parts e.g. an extremity (hands and feet) or the lungs.  
- Brownian Motion: The Brownian motion of viruses is slow and by Brownian motion alone a virion usually just moves a few micro meters to reach close by cells. However if given enough time virions can diffuse to many locations both within tissues or within cells. 


<!--td move in out-->


#### Movement between hosts
[in work]
Many forms of life cannot move well on their own: Plants, bacteria and fungi. In the oceans this is less a problem thanks to the currents. On land however, all forms of life with no ability to move have the challenge to spread and genetically interact. The main options are the same for them all: Being carried by wind, water or moving organisms. Virions have to rely on this options to spread through a host populations:

* __Moveable Organism__: This is often the host where the virus was built but it can be an animal primarily transporting the virion called a transporter. 

    > ###### Transporter
    > A *transporter* for a virus is an organism which is important for its transport function in the life cycle of a virus.

    When the transporter moves the virions move with it. The farther, faster and the more possible hosts at new location the better for the virus to distribute. Optimal transportation are migrating and/or fare flying animals: flying insects, birds and bats. The usage of horses and the inventions of trains, cars and airplanes made us humans new optimal hosts. Jetting around the world from city to city is optimal for viruses since: fast travel to a new set of hosts. 

<!--
- Movement induced by the organism:-->

* __Wind__: Many plants rely on wind for spread. Some viruses too, but not many since wind driven movement has challenges:
    - The movements induced by wind are random in the sense that evolutionary adaption to directional movement is hardly possible.
      => Organisms relying on wind usually compensate this randomness often with huge numbers. As can be seen each season by the pollen powdering the landscape.  
    - The air contains reactive oxygen and sunlight exposure is frequent. Therefore genetic material needs to be well protected.
    - Particles need to have large surface in comparison to their mass, else gravity will ground them (explained in [Objects Moving in the Air](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#objects-moving-in-the-air)). Except for very small particles only dry particles have a surface large enough to fly. 

    Different life forms solved these challenges: 
    * Many plants rely on wind both for genetic recombination and spread. 
    * Viruses spread with the winds is quite rare, since 
      * The large numbers needed to compensate the undirected movement with the wind, are hard to achieve for viruses.
      * viruses since they don't encode their entire metabolism have fewer options to optimize for stability and survive the harsh life condition in the air.
      * Viruses and especially RNA viruses aren't stable in sunlight.
  
      Exception: smallpox. Coronaviruses may do so in theory.    

* __Water__: 
    Water movement is directional to the oceans and particles need to be "fished out" not to end up there. One of the few escape options are drinking animals. 
    * Land-plants rarely use water since ending up in the oceans is not the goal of land plants.
    * Viruses infecting animals rely on water. Animals drinking brings them directly to possible hosts. 


#### Travel Probabilities
Getting matched to an infectable cell involves the following steps (steps in [...] are facultative):
- [reach a host]  
- [reach a tissue]
- reach an infectable cell

Each step has usually a low success rate. So the combined probability of reaching a target tends to be very small. 

The probability to reach a *next* exploitable host, is especially low, due to many traps and hostile environment:
* get attached to a wrong thing. High probability due to the random movement and usually the surface of non targets is fare greater than the target surface. Except confined indoor settings, in this case the surface of the combined lungs is the greatest surface - greater than the surface of all the walls.  
* sunlight destroys virions. 
* heat
* chemical environment
