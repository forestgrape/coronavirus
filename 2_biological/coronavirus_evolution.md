## Evolution Speed
The genetic evolution of coronaviruses is fast compared to other [forms of life](./life-forms.md) because:
* a short average generation-time (only a few hours [to be confirmed]) 
* Genome is [encoded in single stranded RNA](./life-forms.md#lifetime-storage). 
  * RNA mutates more than DNA and is more difficult to correct
  * single stranded genomes are less stable than double stranded
  * properties of their genome copying:
    * [single stranded RNA](../2_biological/life-forms.md#ssRNA) is copied by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which yields a higher rate of random point errors (mutations) compared to DNA polymerases
    * a homologous recombination mechanism [[Woo et al.](#woo)] , more refs coming]
* A large overall populations size = (within host population) * (number of infected hosts)
  * large population size within hosts. 
  * the number of infected hosts can be large (for Sars-CoV-2)

* Coronaviruses have large genomes (in comparison to other RNA viruses or messenger RNAs) which both back the recombination and encode complex proteins. The coronavirus RNA genome is among the largest strands of RNA occurring on todays earth, possibly even the largest [to check].  



## Terminology

> **in work and subject to changes**

##### Virus Lineage
> A lineage of viruses denotes all viruses originating from a single virus. In the case of recombination, the recombined virus belongs to both lineages.

* The term lineage is independent of mutations and just denotes a parent offspring relationship.

##### Coronavirus Species
> A coronavirus species denotes a collection of lineages of coronaviruses which readily undergo recombination.

* The above definition is analog to the definition of species for animals with sexual recombination, where a species denotes a set of lineages with can recombine.
* The above definition means the viruses draw from the same gene pool.

##### Virus Variant
>> A virus variant is a collection of virus lineages which are closely related but differ in their behavior.

##### Virus Strain
>> A virus variant is a collection of virus lineages where the members share the behavior but not necessarily the structure or sequence. 

* Members of a variant may differ in a couple of point mutations at the amino acid level which don't change the behavior. 



## Evolution Mechanisms
* Spontaneous Mutation
* Duplication Error
* Recombination



## Evolution Variations across the Genome


### Slow Mutating Regions

> in raw work and incomplete

#### Reason for Conservation
Internal proteins of viruses are more difficult to target for the immune system, therefore the corresponding genes have less evolutionary drive to mutate.
Functional units of proteins. The more conserved the function is, the more conserved they tend to be.
* The replication mechanism of coronaviruses is well conserved and thus the proteins involved.

#### Examples of Conserved Parts
Examples of well conserved genes of coronaviruses are:
* RNA viruses need to duplicate their RNA for replication, which requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein. Core parts of this protein are well conserved [to check and cite]. 
* The coronavirus RNA is packaged with the help of a nucleocapsid protein, usually denoted by N. 

### Fast Mutating Regions

> in raw work and incomplete

* The N terminal part of the spike protein mutates frequently. By such mutations coronaviruses can evade neutralizing antibodies (described on the page [Immune Evasion](./../4_immunological/immune_evasion.md)).
