## Evolution Speed
The genetic evolution of coronaviruses is fast compared to other [forms of life](./life-forms.md) because:
* a short average generation-time (only a few hours [to be confirmed]) 
* Genome is [encoded in single stranded RNA](./life-forms.md#lifetime-storage). 
  * RNA mutates more than DNA and is more difficult to correct
  * single stranded genomes are less stable than double stranded
  * properties of their genome copying:
    * [single stranded RNA](../2_biological/life-forms.md#ssRNA) is copied by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which yields a higher rate of random point errors (mutations) compared to DNA polymerases
    * a homologous recombination mechanism [[Woo et al.](#woo)] , more refs coming]
* A large overall populations size = (within host population) * (number of infected hosts)
  * large population size within hosts. 
  * the number of infected hosts can be large (for Sars-CoV-2)

* Coronaviruses have large genomes (in comparison to other RNA viruses or messenger RNAs) which both back the recombination and encode complex proteins. The coronavirus RNA genome is among the largest strands of RNA occurring on todays earth, possibly even the largest [to check].  



## Terminology

> **in work and subject to changes**

##### Virus Lineage
> A lineage of viruses denotes all viruses originating from a single virus. In the case of recombination, the recombined virus belongs to both lineages.

* The term lineage is independent of mutations and just denotes a parent offspring relationship.

##### Coronavirus Species
> A coronavirus species denotes a collection of lineages of coronaviruses which readily undergo recombination.

* The above definition is analog to the definition of species for animals with sexual recombination, where a species denotes a set of lineages with can recombine.
* The above definition means the viruses draw from the same gene pool.

##### Virus Variant
>> A virus variant is a collection of virus lineages which are closely related but differ in their behavior.

##### Virus Strain
>> A virus variant is a collection of virus lineages where the members share the behavior but not necessarily the structure or sequence. 

* Members of a variant may differ in a couple of point mutations at the amino acid level which don't change the behavior. 



## Evolution Occurrence and Mechanisms
* Spontaneous Mutation
* Duplication Error
* Recombination



## Evolution Variations across the Genome

> This section is written generally and valid for most life forms

### Effects of Genome Evolution

#### Change the Evolutionary Stability
Changing the RNA or protein structure even without immediate effects on the function can influence future mutations. This can yield more mutative or more stable progeny.

+/-: 
  * In a changing environment with relaxed survival constraints, a mutative state is advantageous regarding the change of functions.
  * Exposed to immune responses targeting molecular patterns, change of molecular appearance is beneficial.

#### Change the Functioning
Change the function which is beneficial if the previous functioning was suboptimal and the new function does better.

+/-: Most mutations do *not* improve the function. However if they do the advantage can be significant. 
  * If the life-form is not well adapted to the environment, function improvement upon function change is more likely.
  * If the life-form is in an environment with relaxed fitness constraints, delirious  mutations are better tolerated.

#### Change the Molecular Appearance
Changing the appearance can yield escape from immune system recognition. 

+: Escaping the immune system is often beneficial or even required for a virus lineage to survive.


### Determinants of Evolutionary Rate

> in raw work and incomplete

#### Immune Evasion Drive
* Exposure:* Internal proteins of viruses are more difficult to target for the immune system, therefore the corresponding genes have less evolutionary drive to mutate.
  * The N terminal part of the spike protein mutates frequently. By such mutations coronaviruses can evade neutralizing antibodies (described on the page [Immune Evasion](./../4_immunological/immune_evasion.md)).
* *Expression Level:* Proteins with low expression levels: The immune system learning system comes more in contact with frequent proteins and thus learns them more likely.
  * For coronaviruses (for most other viruses too) the non structural proteins have much lower expression levels than the structural proteins.
  * The share of proteins mass is as follows: 1. N protein, 2. S protein, 3. E Protein, 4. M Membrane Protein [to finish, check and cite]

#### Functional Drive
* *Conserved Function:* Functional units of proteins. The more conserved the function is, the more conserved they tend to be.
  * The replication mechanism of coronaviruses is well conserved and thus the proteins involved e.g. functional parts of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein [to check and cite]. 
* *Adapted Function:*
  * The receptor binding 

## Observed Evolution
* Bovine coronaviruses spread from cattle to many ungulates both domestic and wild [to cite].
* In cell cultures coronavirus can adapt within a couple of generations. E.g. 
  * they can adapt such that the virions tolerate high temperature (55 degrees) better [Laude](../2_biological/virion_viability.md#summary-laude).
* SARS-CoV-2 jumps to domestic animals and adapts.
