## Summary  

##### Summarized Observations
Omicron is a SARS-CoV-2 lineage. However it has features different from all previous lineages (usually referred as variants) of SARS-CoV-2:
* *Symptoms:* Rather than a typical respiratory disease, there are reports for more systemic symptoms such as night sweets and tiredness. Cough is still observed though.
* *Transmission:* 
  * Previous infections provide a lower protection compared to the protection they provided against previous variants.
  * The transmission rate is much higher than observed for all previous variants. This is the case in many different settings: household transmission, social events and populations level increase in cases. Noteworthy, many locations where very high transmission rates are observed have high vaccination rates.
* *Mutation Distribution:* Omicron has a lot of mutations in the spike of which a surprisingly large number in RBD. In the NTD part of the spike there is also an insertion which hasn't been seen before. NSP6 mutated also at an increased mutation rate. The mutation rate in the other genes seems to be at a comparative level as observed for other variants.
##### Possible Explanations
In the following two possible explanations for these observations are outlined. Explanation 1 states the hypothesis that Omicron has a changed tropism and can replicate in immune cells such as macrophages. This is a speculative hypothesis. Explanation 2 is close to the standard explanation stated: Omicron mutated to escape spike targeting antibodies. The immune escape gained yields a  transmission advantage.

###### Possible Explanation 1: How an altered Tropism explain the Changes
One possible observation for the above observations, is a shift of tropism away from differentiated respiratory tract epithelial cells towards immune cells such as macrophages:
* *Symptoms:* Symptoms such as night sweets and tiredness are frequently observed for pathogens with a tropism for macrophages such as HIV, tuberculosis and some flaviviruses.
* *Transmission:* The higher infection rates can be explained by S targeting antibody mediated infection enhancement (AIE): Virions opsonized with S targeting antibodies are taking up by phagocytes such as macrophages, where Omicron virions are able to replicate. The infections does not depend anymore on the virus randomly match with an epithelial cell but rather the immune cells actively take up the virions.
  * The lowered but still available protections from previous infections can be explained as follows while AIE increases the infection rate however the T cells and N targeting antibodies still provide protection. The increase infection rate are very unlikely due to immune evasion alone since 1) Omicron is not much mutated in major targets in immune targets induced by natural infections such as the E and N protein and 2) for the previous variants such as alpha, beta and delta hardly any protection reduction of natural immunity has been observed despite these variants also have a quite a few mutations. 
  * The very high transmission rate in settings with a high rate of vaccinated can be explained by AIE i.e. antibody mediated infection of immune cells. 
* *Mutation Distribution:* The spike of coronaviruses is a key determinant which cells they enter and a changed tropism would explain the high number of mutations. The mutation distribution with many mutation in the RBD indicates a relaxed evolutionary pressure on the RBD, alternate entry pathways could have enable this high mutation rate. The insertion in NTD of domain of the spike is possibly acquired from the human coronavirus E229, a human coronavirus which frequently enters macrophages.

> Antibody dependent disease enhancement (ADE) denotes when antibodies increase the disease. ADE is mainly observed for RNA+ viruses such as flaviviruses (e.g. dengue virus) and some coronaviruses (e.g. feline coronavirus). ADE can be due to an increased infection i.e. higher viral loads, an increase immune pathology without increased viral loads or both combined.

> Here the term AIE for Antibody induced Infection Enhancement (AIE) is used. AIE is used here, since the observations indicate that the infection probability is increased by spike targeting antibodies. 

> The effects of the different kinds of acquired immunity on the overall disease burden from Omicron infections are currently to some extent unclear. The symptoms seem to be different as noted and early data indicate, that the antibodies themselves enhance the probability of infection. This could result in a disease enhancement so there there would be an ADE effect. However other parts of acquired immunity such as T cells may ameliorate the disease. Therefore it is possible that overall acquired immunity still has protective effect against severe disease; the effects likely depend on the exact type of acquired immunity i.e. the type of vaccine or natural infection with the different variants.

A change of tropism towards macrophages is possible in theory since other human coronaviruses such as MERS and E229 can infect and replicate inside macrophages. Additionally a tropism for macrophages is observed for animal coronaviruses. Arteriviruses which also belong to the order of Nidovirales and share key molecular features even mainly have a tropism for myeloid immune cells [to confirm and cite].

###### Possible Explanation 2: How Escape of Spike binding Antibodies could explain the Observations
The spike mutations enable Omicron to escape spike binding antibodies: Antibodies induced by previous variants or by vaccines based on previous variants bind much less to the Omicron spike than all other lineages so fare. This reduces the protection by spike targeting antibodies. 
* For muscular administrated vaccines, for which spike targeting antibodies are likely central to the immunity in the conducting respiratory tract, the protection against infection in the conducting airways likely significantly decreases or even vanishes (a protection in the lungs - i.e. against pneumonia - through circulating T cells recognizing also epitopes in the S2 part of the spike is still excepted). 
* For naturally acquired immunity a reduction of protection occurs since one part of natural immunity are spike targeting antibodies. The magnitude of this effect depends how important spike targeting antibodies are for naturally acquired immunity.

###### Likelihood of the Explanations
_Likelihood by the Immune Protection Mechanism:_
The likelihood of the possible explanations depends by which mechanism(s) the acquired immunity works both for vaccines and natural infections. Acquired immunity can protect through:
* Antibody mediated immunity. Antibodies can provide protection through neutralizing activity (spike binding only and mostly RBD) and by opsonizing to virions for phagocytosis (spike binding only) or for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (Chapter [Antibodies](../4_immunological/antibodies.md)).
* T cells mediated immunity. One form of protection by T cell immunity are cytotoxic CD8 cells which detect and eliminate infected cells. In the conducting airways (bronchi, trachea, to some extent URT) these are mostly Tissue resident T cells [to confirm and cite].

For coronavirus immunity all the above mechanism are observed. The relative importance of the different mechanisms is not quite clear (yet) however. Natural infection induce both antibodies and tissue resident T cells. There is good evidence that tissue resident T cells play an important role. Explanation 2 though, is only likely when the protection is predominately provided by spike binding antibodies, else there is not reason that Omicron escapes natural immunity better than other variants, since Omicron just mutated much in the outer part of the spike but not in other antigenic sites targeted by natural acquired immunity. Thus explanation 2 is less likely.

_Likelihood by the observed Transmission Rates:_
Additionally the extremely high attack rates observed e.g. at single dinner over 70% of the participants got infected. Such high attack rates are more likely for viruses infecting immune cells and thus make explanation 1 more likely.


##### Summarized Significance
A change of tropism towards immune cells could have profound effects:
* Acquired immunity is not necessarily helpful anymore. Since if Omicron can replicate well in immune cells, antibody mediated uptake can yield to an increased replication which is a form of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).
* The disease could change from a virulent respiratory tract disease causing ARDS towards a more subtle disease infecting immune cells if the tropism for epithelial cells is indeed reduced.
  
The SARS-like disease patterns could disappear and omicron induced disease could become prevalent. They could be quite different. Possibly less virulent but more systemic.

## Genetics of Omicron
> in work
* *Spike Mutations*: So fare the successful variants had below unique 10 mutations in the spike. Omicron has 26 mutations. Of these mutations 15 are in the RBD. The variants alpha to delta just have 3 or less mutations. In the NTD (most exposed part of the spike) there are 6 deletions, 4 mutations and 1 insertion: EPE, where as e.g. lambda has 7 deletions and 3 mutations.
* Apart from the spike mutations there 4 mutations in NSP6 compared to 1 mutations

> This study does not tell a tropism for macrophages, it just indicates a changed tropism. A tropism for the bronchi could explain some vaccine escape since they are farther away from systemic immunity. However from a tropism for the bronchi alone, a reduction in the immunity induced by natural infections is unlikely.

* The results from a cohort analysis on household transmission between 15 and 28 November 2021 with 72761 Delta index cases and 121 Omicron index cases yields a 2.6 unadjusted odds ratio increase and an increase of 3.2 if adjusted (Table 2.).
* Data from the NHS test and trace system from November (Delta) and early December (Omicron) show: From Table 3 it is visible that the household attack rate of Omicron is with 21.6% about double as high than the attack rate for Delta which is 10.7%. The adjusted OR is 2.09 (1.54 - 2.79).
* The risk for reinfection for Omicron seems to be much higher than for delta: a preliminary adjusted estimate is 5.2 (95% CI: 3.4 to 7.6) // 25 of 361 were reinfections whereas 336 of 85460 non Omicron cases between 20.11. and 5.12; adjustment seems to be important due systematic biases as noted in the text on page 22.
* In Figure 9 the variation of spike mutation in the sub-lineages BA.1 and BA.2 are displayed.
* In Figure 10 a maximum likelihood phylogeny for Omicron VOC-21Nov-01 (B.1.1.529) genomes as of 7 December 2021 is shown. South african but also US and UK samples are well distributed across the tree.
