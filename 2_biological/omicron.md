## Summary  
The Omicron is a variants of SARS-CoV-2. However is has features different from all previous variants:
* Different Symptoms: Rather than a typical respiratory disease, there are reports for more systemic symptoms such as night sweets and tiredness. Cough is still observed though.
* The transmission rate is much higher than observed for all previous variants. This is the case in many different settings: household transmission, social events and populations level increase in cases. Noteworthy this is the case in settings where many people are vaccinated.
* The number and distribution of mutations. Omicron has many mutations in the spike of which a surprisingly large number in RBD and a new insertion in the NTD part of the spike.

The above observations can be explained by a shift of tropism away from differentiated respiratory tract epithelial cells towards immune cells mainly towards macrophages:
* Symptoms such as night sweets and tiredness are frequently observed for pathogens with a tropism for macrophages such as HIV, tuberculosis and some flaviviruses.
* The very high transmission rate in settings with a high rate of vaccinated can be explained by antibody mediated infection of immune cells. The infections does not depend anymore on the virus randomly match with an epithelial cell but rather the immune cells actively take up the virions.
* The spike of coronaviruses is a key determinant which cells they enter and a changed tropism would explain the high number of mutations. The mutation distribution with many mutation in the RBD indicates a relax evolutionary pressure on the RBD, thus alternate entry pathways are likely. The insertion in NTD of domain of the spike is possibly acquired from the human coronavirus E229, a human coronavirus which frequently enters macrophages.

A change of tropism towards macrophages is possible in theory since other human coronaviruses such as MERS and E229 can infect and replicate inside macrophages. Additionally a tropism for macrophages is observed for  animal coronaviruses. Arteriviruses which also belong to the order of Nidovirales and share key molecular features even mainly have a tropism for myeloid immune cells [to confirm and cite].

Such a change of tropism could have profound effects:
* Acquired immunity is not necessarily helpful anymore. Since if omicron can replicate well in immune cells, antibody mediated uptake can yield to an increased replication which is a form of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).
* The disease could change from a virulent respiratory tract disease causing ARDS towards a more subtle disease infecting immune cells if the tropism for epithelial cells is indeed reduced.
  
The SARS-like disease patterns could disappear and omicron induced disease could become prevalent. 



## Observations and Features of Omicron
### Genetics of Omicron
> in work
* *Spike Mutations*: So fare the successful variants had below unique 10 mutations in the spike. Omicron has 26 mutations. Of these mutations 15 are in the RBD. The variants alpha to delta just have 3 or less mutations. In the NTD (most exposed part of the spike) there are 6 deletions, 4 mutations and 1 insertion: EPE, where as e.g. lambda has 7 deletions and 3 mutations.
* Apart from the spike mutations there 4 mutations in NSP6 compared to 1 mutations
