#### setup
- The PExA device consists of an optical particle counter that can measure number and size of exhaled particles (PEx) with an impactor where the particles are sampled on a membrane for subsequent biochemical analysis. 

- A total of 32 patients were included and all patients signed a written informed consent. 26 patients were included in the mechanical ventilation cohort and were subsequently divided into two cohorts; 17 patients with NSCLC (MV-NSCLC) and nine patients without NSCLC (MV-C). Another group of six patients with NSCLC who were not intubated was also included (NB). 

- In awake patients, here described as normal breathing, a special breathing manoeuvre is used, to reinforce airway closure and re-opening [9]. 

- Previously it has been shown that a change in the composition of the RTLF reflects different airway diseases [1, 2, 10–13].

- Particles in exhaled air were collected using a two-stage inertial impactor, described in previous articles [9, 10, 14]. Mass spectrometry was used to quantify the phospholipids di-palmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (DPPC) and palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphocholine (POPC). The method is described in previous articles [2, 15]. Albumin and SP-A were analysed by ELISA, described in previous articles [12, 13, 16, 17].

#### abbrev
- _respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF)_
- particle flow rate (PFR): measuref with optical counter
- particles were collected onto a membrane for biochemical analysis and referred to as PEx.

-  Number of particles are described as particles per minute, named particle flow rate (PFR). Particles were collected onto a membrane for biochemical analysis and referred to as PEx.

- Particles in exhaled air were collected using a two-stage inertial impactor, described in previous articles [9, 10, 14].  Albumin and SP-A were analysed by ELISA, described in previous articles [12, 13, 16, 17].

#### methods
- on PEx: Mass spectrometry was used to quantify the phospholipids di-palmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (DPPC) and palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphocholine (POPC). The method is described in previous articles [2, 15].


#### facts
- __SP-A__ is predominantly being produced by __alveolar epithelial__ cells and secreted into the alveolar space.
- it has been suggested previously that PEx are derived from the opening and closing of the distal airways and alveoli [3]
- PEx are thought to originate from the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) that covers the epithelial wall of the airways [4–8]. 



#### results
* Results: MV-NSCLC and MV-C had significantly lower numbers of particles exhaled per minute (particle flow rate; PFR) compared to NB. MV-NSCLC and MV-C also had a siginificantly lower amount of phospholipids in PEx when compared to NB. MV-NSCLC had a significantly lower amount of surfactant A compared to NB.



* Biochemical collection achievable in mechanically ventilated patients during surgery
    In addition to differences in PFR, we also sought to further understand the composition of the PEx as this most likely correlates with their origin. We looked at __expression levels of DPPC and POPC which are major components of SP-A__ along with albumin. They are all believed to originate from the RTLF with albumin thought to be more universally expressed along the airway lining fluid while SP-A is predominantly being produced by alveolar epithelial cells and secreted into the alveolar space. DPPC and POPC were detected in all samples and showed significantly lower levels for mechanically ventilated patients compared to NB. The opening and closure of the distal airways are likely to be more prominent in the NB group compared with mechanically ventilated patients due to differences in their breathing. We could also see lower concentrations of DPPC and POPC in MV-C and MV-NSCLC, compared with NB. This indicates that that PEx from NB more prominently represents the distal airways as compared to mechanically ventilated patients.
