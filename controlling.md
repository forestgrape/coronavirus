## Strategy 
> Mind set followed here to tackle SARS-CoV-2:
> * communication and explanation
> * knowledge & research
> * self responsibility, independent decisions combined with a circumspect lifestyle
> * Focus on overall life quality. This includes keeping overall health effects in mind: comparing different risks and the number of diseases and deaths caused, long-term damage, life quality cost (which can include economic costs). <!--// for things harmful and/or unwanted, advertisements restrictions are an option. It is always about acquiring new customers into an industry and not about competing on existing customers else the industry would cheer on saving ad costs. -->
> * Moderate measures preserving life quality.
> * Keep the spread controllable and react if necessary. E.g. limiting super-spreader situation since they can yield sudden and hard to control explosion in cases.
> * Monitor and estimate overall cases to do predictions and planning.
> * Settings that those who want/need can protect, while those not needing/choosing can go on, go on circumspectly.
> * Avoiding hospital overwhelming. Since it is hard for all the affected: the relatives, the medical staff and the patients. At times when shops, restaurants and bars are open and crowded, risking with a high probability or considering *not* to admit elderly to hospitals I think is not nice. **Everybody has to right for a good treatment.**
>
> ### Reconsidering Strategy
> In cold areas/times rules need to be tighter, since aerosol transmission is hard to (self-)prevent at least if good masks are scarce. In warm areas windows should be open all the time and air-conditioning should *never* be used.
> 
> Three more points
> 1. Trying new paths but step by step and at the risk of falling having a parachute ready and using it early enough. Better walk with the parachute (and being ready for a new journey) than fall cool without. For Covid-19 the parachutes are outdoor days: being outdoors and avoiding all non essential entries to foreign or public indoor settings.
> 2. Doing experiments in limited/small settings.   
> 3. Analyzing missteps can be rewarding, the next antibiotics are to be discovered.


## Spread Assumptions
The following relies on the assumption that the main transmission of Sars-CoV-2 is [airborne](./transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission) (primarily through aerosol and even dry form aerosol, possibly some droplet transmission). 

Observations:
Evidence for aerosol transmission is described in [Spread Analyses](./spread_analyses.md) and the proposed dry form model in [Airborne Transmission Models](./transmission.md). In short: The [spread pattern](./spread_analyses.md) shows that the cases of severe SARS-2 lung infections are high when a lot of air is exchanged between people which is the case in badly ventilated indoor rooms either heated (cold climates e.g. winters in Europe) or air-conditioned (very warm/sultry climates e.g. observed in Southern US in summer or regions of Brazil year round). On the other hand outdoors during the day, even in situations with dense crowds such as demonstrations or crowded swimming pools, no increased spread has been observed.

To keep in mind:
* Dry Air: In dry air tiny aerosol form, which are most likely to enter the deep lungs [Airborne Transmission Models](./transmission.md). The [viability of coronaviruses](./virion_viability.md) in the air is highest in dry and cool air without sunlight.
* Symptomatic and severely sick patients are more infectious (The section [Infectors and Symptom Status](./spread_analyses.md#infectors-and-symptom-status) on the page [Spread Patterns](./spread_analyses.md)). => (Encouraging) Transparency is important.


Metaphor:
Airborne transmissions can be thought [smoke like](./transmission.md#metaphor-and-measures) or like the reek of alcohol in the case of droplet transmission (which is less relevant regarding severe Covid). For the first non-smokers protections measures are suitable and for the latter distancing is enough. 

=> In situations when a smokers smokes can not be smelled the risk is low, if it can ventilation or masks help.
=> Outdoor activities reduce the overall Covid burden. Indoor activities and meetings can increase the Covid spread.


## Protection Measures
### Support Immune Protection
Completely avoiding Sars-CoV-2 can be as hard as avoiding dust and smoke. This is hard. Even in laboratory settings virus protection is difficult [[Wurtz, Raoult et al](#raoult), [Artika and Ma'roef](#artika)] and  Sars-CoV-1/2 protection is especially difficult. There have been several cases of infections in labs with Sars-CoV-1 [Orellana et al](#orellana), [Lim et al](#lim) and recommendations for autopsies of Covid-19 fatalities are very strict [Finegan et al](#finegan). Out of labs, once a coronavirus is widespread, complete avoidance is nearly impossible. Sars-Cov-2 is widespread. The best protection available is a good immune system. Vaccines - if once available - just prepare the immune system and do not replace it. So the long-term focus should be to support the overall health of humanity. In tropical regions where Sars-CoV-2 infects less virulent but there are many more infectious diseases, this should be the main focus (along with open windows and no air-conditioners if there are Covid-19 cases).

Proposals for good health:
* providing settings that support good health
    - allow people outside to move
    - environmental protection including clean air
* lessen stress 
    - secure and affordable life including basic health care
    - less pressure overall
* Healthy nutrition 
* Providing information and tips to focus on health and the immune system

There are many more reasons good health - including an intact immune system - is important.


### Masks
Mask reduce spread since they mitigate both the infection and spread risk. Masks should be changed frequently but can be reused.
To prevent droplet transmission outdoors or in very well ventilated situations any mask helps. To prevent aerosol transmission indoors a good filtration and clean mask is necessary. The filtration of most surgical masks is ok. FFP masks or analog have good to very good filters. A good and dense fit is important, especially for masks with a high filtration. More on the page [Masks](./masks.md).


### Ventilation
Ventilation reduces the indoor airborne spread, since the virion density in [outside air](#outside-is-safer) is much lower than in indoor air. There should be limits on the CO2 concentration and the concentration should be continuously monitored. 

* [Escombe et al](#escombe) show natural ventilation is a valid measure and that in the first few minutes of opening the windows a major part of air is exchanged ([escombe: Figure 1](#https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040068.g001)).
* [Salathe et al](#salathe) simulate the airborne (aerosol) and droplet spread of influenza, based on observed contact patters of high school students. In the simulation, good ventilation is as effective as immunizing around half of the population. // in the paper vaccinate is used instead of immunize, however there's evidence vaccinating against influenza does not stop spreading.


### Distancing
[Airborne transmission](./transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission) - both droplets (reek of alcohol like spread) and aerosol/dry particulates (smoke-like) - can be reduced with distancing. Outside or with good ventilation, less distance is required. So if inside 2 meters is good, outside likely half a meter is enough. Wind direction should be considered outside. Inside, the airflow can have a direction too: e.g. the kitchen hood and the toilet venting draw air.


### Large Buildings
Large residential block and office buildings special care needs to be taken, since the transmission risk is increased: 
* Epidemiological evidence: [Living Conditions](./spread_analyses.md#living-conditions) in the chapter [Spread Analyses](./spread_analyses.md)
* Biological evidence: viruses can survive quite long at lower air temperatures without sunlight such as stairwells (chapter [Virion Viability](./virion_viability.md)). 

Suggested precaution measures:
* Good filtration masks should be used in shared stairwells. 
* The stairwell should be ventilated regularly. 
* Flats/offices should be ventilated before opening the door to the stairwell, especially if sick.
* Easy access to Covid-19 tests.


### Covid-19 Cases and Quarantine
The focus should be on monitoring cases both for disease progression and to figure out and break infection paths. 
Relaxed rules are important for the [health of the infected and the possibly infected](./covid19.md#movement) and in many situations relaxed rules are more efficient in reducing the spread:

#### Example Calculation of Spread
* ##### Strict Instructions
  With strict quarantine measures, infection risk from known infected is more reduced but fewer people may do tests. Example: Out of 10 infected, 5 are known and 5 unknown/untested
  * the 5 known may infect on average 2 others (thus having a R value of 0.4)
  * the 5 untested may infect 10 others (having a R value of 2.0)
  
  Overall the 10 infected people infect 12 others and so an overall R value of 1.2.
  
* ##### Relaxed Instructions
  With relaxed instructions the known infected may on average infect more people but the number of unknown infected is smaller.  Overall this yields a smaller R value. Example out of 10 infected 8 are known and 2 unknown:
  * the 8 known infect 4 others (R value of 0.5 for known infected)
  * the 2 unknown infect 4 others (R value of 2.0)
  
  Overall the 10 infected infect 8 others corresponding to an overall R value of 0.8

Overall in the above scenario the relaxed instruction yield an overall lower spread since more people do testing/are transparent about symptoms.


#### Suggestions for possibly Infected
* mask wearing in all public indoor spaces and best in all indoor rooms where susceptible people can be.
* no crowded indoor spaces
* distance: 1 meters outdoors and 2 meters indoors.
* no face-to-face talking without a mask
* regular ventilation
* avoid excessive strains e.g. strenuous sports
* avoid indoor activities with heavy breathing/deep inhaling e.g. sport and singing/shouting

#### Suggestions for Infected
as for [Possibly Infected](#suggestions-for-possibly-infected) and additionally
* [High-filtration mask](./masks.md#high-filtration) in all indoor spaces/rooms where people to protect are. Including the own building (stairwell e.g. for laundry/going outside) and the flat e.g. when living in flat sharing. The mask should be changed frequently.
* No crowded places (outdoors and indoors)
* Distance: 2 meters outdoors and 4 meters indoors.
* No close range face-to-face talking
* Ventilate the room and flat before opening extern doors ([Large Buildings](#large-buildings)). Ideally ventilate before opening the personal room and open the door reduced.

#### Isolation by Home-Lockdown
To reduce spread isolation by home-lockdown is a radical measure. The more is known about Sars-CoV-2 and its spreading the more fine-grained the measures can be.
* Isolation should be used with care since it can discourage people from testing and being transparent e.g. disclosing socials contacts and travel history.
* There are good reasons against home isolation:
    - Going outside is important for an intact immune system and good health. This is important for infected too.
    - Indoor movement/light sports can produce a lot of exhaled breadth condensate/aerosols and thus put people in the same building at risk.

  Preventing spread opportunities e.g. avoiding indoor and/or crowded public spaces is important.

Isolation by a stay-at-home-order may be working for people with own houses with gardens but for people living in flats in big buildings (and the majority of people do so in Covid risk regions), permanent home stay can increase transmission opportunities and has adverse health effects since movement is healthy.


## Control Measures
[in work]

### Contact Tracing
[in work]

### Testing Benefits
Often turning up for test is not associated with any benefits, on the contrary if tested positive for Covid in many countries a home [isolation rules](#covid-19-cases-and-quarantine) apply and one needs to disclose contacts and possibly movement history. A different approach is whitelist testing e.g. those who test negative get benefits. 
* Experiences: 
  * Many countries require negative tests for entry. 
  * In Slovakia in early November 2020 a nationwide testing campaign and only those with negative tests were excluded from a general curfew. 
    > A new tactics and it will be interesting to analyze it. A general curfew I consider to strict in any situation including this. Only allowing people with negative tests to enter foreign indoor settings (e.g. gastronomy/offices) should be enough.

    > A tactics like this could be applied locally in regions: Just those with negative are allowed to leave the region and enter foreign indoor rooms. 


High filtration masks should be used in shared stairwells and the flats should be ventilated before opening the door. 


### Outdoor Days
Avoiding foreign and public indoor rooms. So either at home or being outdoors. Prevents aerosol transmission if care is taken in [buildings](#large-buildings) and [shops](#shops). To prevent (the likely less relevant) droplet transmission, masks can be used for face to face talking outdoors.


### Home-Lock Down
A general curfew is a radical measure. It reduces contacts and makes it easier to enforce a ban on entering foreign indoor rooms. This measure was mainly used in Winter/Spring 2020 when the information about SARS-CoV-2 was more limited and transmission less known. It has very severe drawbacks compared to [outdoor days](#outdoor-days):
* few or no movement for a longer time is not good for health. 
* a lot of aerosol is exhaled when doing indoor sports and this puts fellow occupants and neighbors in the same building at risk.
* being lock indoors can have negative psychological effects.

A curfew at night has some use cases e.g. preventing private parties but in most situations softer measures are enough e.g. [Reduction of Nightlife](#reduction-of-nightlife).



## Thoughts about Social Measures
**(in work and currently more brainstorming)**

This sections discusses measures that can be put in place if Covid-19 increase rapidly. For each measure 
* ###### Evidence
  Epidemiological evidence: Have transmission events been observed in the setting? Can possible transmission events be reliable detected or will most go unnoticed?
* ###### ThinkThrough
  Thinking through/Common sense argumentation/Causal reasoning: Are there transmission opportunities? Are there protection concepts? Are the concepts realistic in practice?
* ###### Experiences
  Experiences with measures in place. Are there experiences and if so what are they?
* ###### Costs/Narrowing
  Narrowing of Life. How individuals experience the measures? Are indirect and/or future costs associated e.g. school children missing education. Financial costs (government support is assumed).
* ###### Comment
  The points above are summarized to subjective rating/comments/recommendations. Subjective since they rely on subjective weighting and subjective rating of the single points. 


> #### Government Support 
> Temporary support for individuals I consider necessary not to disrupt livelihoods. Additionally support for those who need/want to reorganize can be adequate. General notes on support and thoughts how to take the corona-situation as an opportunity to reform the economical systems on the [economics page](./economics.md).
> 
> Some businesses will mainly be closed to break waves (e.g. gastronomy) while other businesses likely are reduced or closed for the foreseeable future (long distance traveling, large scale events).
> 
> As noted restrictions are dependent on the local situation and on the weighting/prioritizing of the benefits and costs. 

### Corona Conform Skiing
[**in work**]
__In short__: Nowadays (pre-corona) practiced cosy warm (après-)skiing is unsafe. The more outside the skiing-experience (including queuing & lifts & gastronomy) is the safer. Good ventilation can make the ski experience more outdoor like. Lowering the maximum crowd density is helps too, especially  indoors.

> My memories of skiing date back to the early 90s, back then a ski day was mostly outdoors from open-sky lifts to outdoor lunch.

> Allowing skiing in some regions first, I consider beneficial, since all can benefit from the experiences gathered. Ideally the situations are closely monitored (e.g. Covid-19 saliva-tests for travellers both on arrival and departure) and all experiences (concepts, monitoring results) are transparently published.

> International travelling can be connected to skiing but mostly skiing and international travelling are independent. Generally for travelling I think in place staying in case of an infection is important i.e. test before leave/travel (as of 30.11. not further discussed on this page).

__ThinkThrough__
Two sides:
* **Skiing itself:** Skiing down some slope has risks, however not virus infections. So regarding SARS-2 skiing itself is safe.
* **Skiing associated:** Skiing as practiced nowadays (before ~~corona~~ corona-measures) involves crowded cableway cabins and room, restaurants and bars and at all locations with different people from different regions and countries. Moreover all this at a very high altitude ( => deep breathing).
  
The points mentioned in skiing associated are known as risk factors for Covid transmission. Accordingly, without (adequate/aerosol) transmission preventions measures many transmissions have been linked to ski resorts in the winter 2020.

__Evidence__
In line with theoretical risk factors (high altitude, sports, dry air in densely populated indoor rooms) - without aerosol protection measures (disinfectants and some droplet preventions were already in place in winter 2020) - many infections occurred in ski resorts.

__Experiences__
In the summer 2020 many mountain locations in the alps were crowded and had running cable cars. To my knowledge no increased Covid-19 incidences and especially no hot-spots were observed.

=> In the summer season, when good ventilation is easy and often practiced and combined with low Covid incidence rates mountain holidays worked well.

__Comment__
Skiing itself is safe but there need to be restrictions on the high risk skiing associated settings. 

> To keep in mind, high altitude and sports increase the amount of air breathed and thus aerosol transmission.

* __cableways__: best unconfined=outdoors and if confined=indoor permanent open/removed windows.
* __tourism buildings__: 
  Good [ventilation](#ventilation) is important.
  * __with jackets__: In building where jackets are worn (e.g. cableway buildings, some sport-shops, self service restaurant where guests sit outside), ventilation can be permanent: Doors and windows are open allowing some draught. Aerosol transmission is efficiently reduced.
  * __without jackets__: In buildings where jackets are not worn (e.g. restaurants, tourist information). Regular ventilation e.g. each hour. Ideally there is a ventilation system or at least an adequate air-cleaning system installed. 
* __queuing__: 
  * Outdoors preferable 
  * Indoor queuing ideally avoided and if then very well ventilated.
  * Ticketing system. Tricky since needs to be working all the time. When everybody waits indoors when the weather is bad, the transmission risk high too. 
  > Yesterday (29.11.) I was on a mountain in the pre-alps. Common protection concepts were in place: mask indoors (good: very well followed and mostly surgical masks), some (partly decorative) disinfectants and plexiglas, a 30% reduction in capacity, some ventilation in the cableways however not nearly as much ventilation as there could be. Concepts mostly worked until everybody - and there were many people since since only the mountains were out of fog - wanted to go down at the same time in the late afternoon: a large crowd lined up indoors and in the beginning with no appropriate ventilation, some even started feeling unwell. The situation improved when doors and windows were opened.
* __gastronomy__: as described in the section [Gastronomy](#gastronomy). In ski resorts there are additional risk because of high altitude, guests from different regions and guests tend to go to many different gastronomy locations during a short time (often days).  
  * __indoor gastronomy__: High risk. Guests from the same villages/hotels going only to a limited number of restaurants helps to prevents chains of (super)spreading and helps contact tracing. 
    > Indoor gastronomy is the highest risk in my opinion. In cableway(-building) ventilation by draught can be used since people can wear warm jackets (sport shops will cheer) and wear clean masks with good filters. But for indoor gastronomy masks, draught & jackets fit less. Ideally some ventilation system is in place.
  * __outdoor gastronomy__: Low risk. Ideally masks are used when getting/bringing food/drinks or going to toilets. 
  * __apres ski__:
    * __indoor__: very high risk often dense crowds and a lot of alcohol (see also indoor gastronomy)
    * __outdoor__: low to medium risk with some distance and limits on alcohol
* __masks__:
  * __outdoor__: any mask including cloths masks and scarf-like to prevent droplet transmission e.g. for staff/ski teachers. 
  * __indoor__: surgical masks or above ([Mask Types](#mask-types)) since:
    *  __Increased Aerosol Transmission__: At high altitude combined with sports, the aerosol transmission is increased.
    *  __Good filter__: Cloths masks, scarfs and so on are hard to distinguish and some of them don't hold back virions in aerosol efficiently. Even good cloths masks offer less [filter performance](#filter-performance) than most surgical masks. 
    *  __Clean masks__: Mask likely offer better protection if fresh/clean [clean masks](#clean-masks). So it is better to go skiing with a bunch of surgical masks and rotate them.

  > Recently I read I a comment from a speaker from a Cableway Association, reading something like: "We cannot and must not control whether people wear clean or the right masks, we trust on the own responsibility." 
  > Several points:
  > * Everybody should encourage and motivate everybody to take good protections. If control is helpful or needed, the system needs to be or at least attempted to be designed such that controlling is possible.
  > * Aerosol transmission plays a role in the transmission of Covid and many cloth masks offer only few protection versus aerosol. // I avow, this is still disputed to some extent. 
  > * Own responsibility is for everyone including operators. If there are few official rules, then there are many specific situations with no general/official rule (e.g. on the mask type). In sensible situations, it can be adequate to set additional rules or do more checks.
  

### Reduction of Nightlife
A slow down of nightlife can reach from an early closure of clubs to a complete stay at home order at night. 
* Evidence:
  * Many anecdote-like Covid-19 spreading events including super spreading events have been linked to nightlife [citations coming]. 
  * That in many countries only few infections can be traced back to nightlife in comparison to transmissions in family settings or private parties can be attributed to trace and test schemes: Contact tracing and testing just works better in family settings. For a club with infected attendees, one week later every attendee should be tested, to my knowledge this is hardly done. In regions with low case counts and extensive contact tracing (e.g. South Korea and Hong Kong) many infections have been traced to nightlife [citations in work].  
* ThinkThrough: Nightlife is about socializing. With loud music distancing is hardly doable. Drinking is common, a risk factor by itself, also prevents mask usage. 
* Experiences:
  * An early closure of nightlife was implemented in (exact measures to be checked, combined with other measures/recommendations)
    * Greece, 11.8.20: closing between 12 pm and 7 am, in risk regions: Athens [to check])
    * Denmark, 15.9.20: closing at 10 pm in risk regions, recommendation to reduce social contact and ending private parties at 10 pm
    * Spain, 14.8.20: closing of nightclubs, bars and restaurants close at 1 am, no drinking on the streets
  
    Two weeks after this measures the incidence of Covid cases flattened in all the above countries. 
    ##### Remark
    Denmark and Greece implemented this measures at low Covid incidences. Spain introduced additional measures later on. 
* Comment: In pandemic times a closure e.g. at 12 pm like implemented in Greece is reasonable; more strict depending on the situation e.g. risk of hospital overflow.  

> I recently (Mid October 2020) read in the news, that people clubbing at 6 am in the morning had to go to quarantine because of a positive guest combined with a faulty guest list.
> 
> Partying until 6 am and likely drinking a lot is not wanted, since protection measures are hardly followed and the immune system is burdened the next day repairing party-damage and may not fight viruses. This is double bad:
>   1. Disease progression: Longer asymptomatic phase and higher viral loads
>   2. Feeling unwell the next day(s) is common and so possible Covid symptoms may be attributed to the party night and therefore are not recognized.

### Reduce Alcohol Consumption
The history of prohibition dates back nearly as long, as history itself has been handed down. Full prohibition never really worked. Today many countries have increased taxes. The taxes mostly are high enough to reduce consumption but low enough that smuggling doesn't pay off. 
* ThinkThrough:
  * Drinking a lot of alcohol diminishes the immune system. Alcohol concentration is higher in the pharynx while drinking and can prevent recognizing symptoms.
  * Alcohol reduces the ability to concentrate and rashly action are more common, that's why no driving. Permanent following of corona prevention measures needs concentration.
* Comment: In restaurants non alcoholic drinks should be noticeable cheaper than alcoholic ones.


### Gastronomy
* Evidence: Where the transmission chains have been analyzed (e.g. Hong Kong, South Korea)[citation in work] it has been shown that in gastronomy, especially in the evening, many transmissions of Covid occur.
* ThinkThrough:
  * Many people from different backgrounds and regions sit often densely in the same room, there for SARS-Cov-2 to spread.
* Comment:
  * Good ventilation and not overly crowded
  * In regions where the death rate is above 2.5 per million and cases are increasing, gastronomy can be reduced at least in the later evening (section [Reduction of Nightlife](#reduction-of-nightlife)).
  * If the epidemiological situation permits, some gastronomy can be left often for those needing them (e.g. living/working alone/not working (e.g. due to Covid)/needing for other reasons), but for most gastronomy dispensable for a few weeks.
  * People working in large groups (e.g. open-plan office) or living in large groups (e.g. families) should take special care regarding Covid-19 transmission, including in gastronomy, since they already are possible angle points for transmission.



### Corona Conform Schooling
Measure regarding schools can reach from complete closure to mild measures such as wearing face-masks in breaks.
* Evidence:  ~~In Israel the reopening of schools seems to have contributed to increased spread~~ **Correction, 24.10.20**: There have been infection clusters in high schools (which have been probably caused by infected teachers, see [Summary Stein-Zamir](./spread_analyses.md#summary-stein-zamir)). But I could *not* find any evidence that the rise in cases after reopening the entire country (not only schools) can be causally linked to schools, neither in Israel nor in any other country. 
  > The early-on update ([Updates 16.10](./index.md#Updates)) was too early, I didn't read and lookup the sources carefully enough. 
* ThinkThrough:
  * Children are **not** main spreaders in the sense that there R value is low [Observations for Schools and Children](./spread_analyses.md#schools-and-children).
  * Biological Background:
    * The SARS-2 receptor ACE2 is not expressed on the vocal folds unlike the influenza A receptor. Therefore aerosol produced when talking are less infectious compared to influenza. 
    * SARS-2 causing severe Covid is mainly spread from the lower lungs but children exhale only rarely particles from the lower lungs and additionally the lungs are rarely infected in children since their immune system is strong. So if children spread then mainly with droplet transmission which can be easily prevented.
  * However:
    * Even with a low R value children can contribute to the overall spread.
    * Many people in the same room and classrooms are not always ventilated well.
    * Many face-to-face talking situations with many different people. Comment, 4.11.20: all evidence points SARS-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted through aerosols from the lung and *not* with droplets.
    * Children all come from different families and inside families protection is not easy but doable if the infection known (children are not super-spreaders).
* Experiences: 
  * School closures were part of lock/shut-downs in spring 2020 in many countries. Mainly due to experiences with influenza, but influenza transmission is different. For SARS-CoV-2 there's evidence, that school closures have little effect. What has been clearly observed however are negative impacts: on the learning experience, on the pupils and the parents/families.
  * In some schools mask wearing is common, negative comments are few
  * Project based and individual learning are common teaching approaches and known to work. 
* Comment: Children [spread Covid-19](./spread_analyses.md) less since they produce less aerosol and have better immune responses. So in areas which struggle with severe Covid situations, instead of complete closures, transmission can be efficiently reduced or even prevented by:
  * Masks when face-to-face talking e.g. in breaks
  * Fewer Exams, Projects can be graded
    * Exams can cause stress. With stress, coronaviruses get forgotten both by the immune system and the behavior.  
    * With common cold like symptoms, one  usually doesn't skip an exam. In Covid times it is important to stay home. On the other hand, skipping an exam on purpose is also easy, some respiratory symptom will pop up. 
  * No talking exercises and more focus on written tasks. 
    * Showing educational movies. 
    * A good time to learn, respectively teach, programming and other computer skills. For computer skills there are many good self learning resources. 
  * More  individual than group work. If group work, then the groups should not change daily (weekly should be ok).
  * Outdoor sports
  * Relaxed presence requirements. E.g. students/pupils can be given tasks and the tasks can be done remotely. Projects can be rescheduled and started earlier. 
  * Library like settings/managed self-learning can be an alternative to closures: students just come to learn/work/read and somebody is there to help when needed (teacher - student protection measures may work better than student-student). Pupils/students can come to read, even if it's reading the favorite book.

## Risk Assessment

### Balancing of Measures
* Monitoring the personal/frequent customers of open(ed) businesses can help to discover a new/increased Sars-CoV-2 spread. Representative samples twice per week should do the job.
* Step by Step adjusting helps to find a balance without many sudden/abrupt changes.
* All people belonging to a risk group for severe Covid-19 should be eligible to obtain free masks from pharmacies and doctors. The health care professionals should evaluate the model for a good fit and instruct the usage.
* Staff and patients of old-age homes, hospitals and similar institutions should monitor their health closely, watch for early Covid-19 signs and have easy access to Covid-19 PCR tests. Tests can also be used to do sampling to have an overview. Early action is important in these settings. Overall good life quality should be the goal, e.g. long-term prohibit visits is likely no solution.


### Outside is Safer
Outside the viruses get diluted and then either are cleared or decay. Due to decay and clearance there's no accumulation. However, outside infection probability is not zero just much smaller than inside - as described in the [transmission section](./transmission.md), outside the main transmission opportunity in face-to-face situations (however droplet infections don't directly and are less likely to induce deep lung infections (hypothesis stated in [Disease Pattering](./ideas_to_explore/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md)). 

Outside there is safer because of:
- [Dilution](#dilution): The virion density decreases rapidly due to the air exchange that is present outdoors. 
- [Virion Clearance](#virion-clearance): Humidity, rainfall and abundant attachment surfaces clear the air from virions. Once attached to natural surfaces, there are countless microorganisms nourishing from anything digestible.
- The [Virion Decay Rate](./virion_viability.md) is high due to sunlight and temperature changes. 

#### Dilution
Outside there is much more air per person than inside:
* In an indoor room with 3 meters high and each person has a distance of 2 meters to the next, there are 12 cubic meters of air per person.
* Even in the most densely populated cities the population density reaches at most 100'000 person per square kilometer. Assuming that only the lower 150 meters of air are mixed, this yields an average of (1'000'000 m^2 * 150 m) / 100'000 persons = 1500 cubic meters of air per person. <!--Compared to an indoor room with a high of 3 meters this corresponds to a distance of 22 meters to the next (if only aerosols transmission and not droplet transmission is taken into account). -->
* Large areas/entire world: Assuming a mixing of air in the lower 1500 density meters and an average population density of about 15 persons per square kilometer:
(1'000'000 * 1500 cubic meters)/15 persons  = 100 million cubic meters of air per person.

#### Virion Clearance
Virion are cleared from the air by the mechanism below and due to [virion decay](#virion-decay) there's no accumulation.
- [Virion Decay](./stability.md) in air: occurs mainly through sun light
- Condensation 
- Washed out by rain
- Virion attachment to non infectable materials which are non living things such as earth, water or rocks or living things which cannot be infected e.g. coronaviruses can *not* infect plants. So outside the vast majority of surfaces are not infectable. 


### Hospital Overwhelming
[**in work**]
Reasons to avoid hospital overwhelming (with good planning some of the reasons can be overcome):
* Everyone has has the right for a fair and good treatment. 
* Opting out of (some) treatments on free will and without any pressure I consider a right too, but for doing so without any pressure, not overwhelmed hospitals are necessary. 
* The overall process can get less efficient. E.g. patients need out of hospital treatment, which has additional challenges.
* Can greatly increase the risk for additional spread since protection measures may not be in place. E.g. the provisional building may not have an appropriate ventilation and temporary personal can be more likely to forget about proper protection measures.
