## Summary
First the conclusion are given and then the observations founding them are sketched. 
#### Conclusions 
1. ##### Covid Transmission happens when much Air is Exchanged between People
    Covid-19 transmission correlates to the amount of air people breadth from each other. The amount of exchanged air is high 
    * indoors air with bad ventilation (either heated or air-conditioned) 
    * increased inhaling
      * being at low air pressure (either high altitude or airplane) 
      * activities such as singing, shouting or strains e.g. sports
      
    The correlation to the amount of air exchanged is expected if the transmission model is a generalized aerosol transmission model (either aerosol or dry form transmission [Summary Airborne Transmission](./transmission.md#summary-airborne-transmission)). For the droplet transmission model the distance and speaking method would be expected to matter most. 

    Regarding prevention measures the takeaway is, that transmission increases with the amount of air exchanged. The exact transmission mechanism may provide additional insights and help fine-tuning but mostly it can be abstracted away. 

#### Observations
Observations indicating that the Covid-19 transmission correlates to inhaled and exhaled air:
1. [Geographical Analysis](#geographical-analysis): Looking at the Covid-19 waves across the world. The waves are predated by situations which favour time spent indoors and bad ventilation. Such situations are cold outside climate (Northern countries in Winter, high altitude), hot outside climate (close to the  Tropics combined with prevalence of air-conditioning e.g. Los Angeles, Florida and Arizona in Southern US, Brazil), in some cases stay at home orders and sometimes spread is increased by cities at high altitude (above 2000 meters: Mexico City, La Paz in Bolivia, Quito in Ecuador, Bogota in Colombia and winter sport locations in the Alps and Rocky Mountains) which increases the amount of air inhaled. 
2. [Population](#population): Analyzing the spread across people: 20% are responsible for 80% of the infections [**in work**]. Children do not spread Covid well. 
3. [Situations with Covid-19 spreading](#spread-situations) is observed or is *not* observed are described and analysed. 
    * [Schools and Children](#schools-and-children)
     Children less susceptible to infection and they spread Covid less than adults. 
    * [Large Scale Sporting Events](#large-scale-sporting-events) In sports clubs where spectators are/were allowed to the stadiums, the players have a much higher risks to get infected with Covid-19 than in regions without spectators. Moreover Covid-19 incidence rates seem to be higher in areas with large scale sport events (especially indoor). 
    * [Airplanes](#airplanes): High spread rates observed without adequate prevention measures (mask, ventilation). 
    * [Large Scale Production Factories](#large-scale-production-factories): Multiple large outbreaks observed mainly in food production factories around the world.

## Geographical Analysis
[in work]


### Methods
For regions across the world the following is analysed:
* Covid-19 cases and deaths to find Covid-waves i.e. time spans with increased spread
* geographical, climate and social situations including measures to flatten/prevent Covid 
  * while cases increase i.e. during the Covid-19 waves 
  * while Covid-19 decrease or stay low despite having a relevant population of possible Covid spreaders (the spread in regions with very low case count where contact tracing can work, behave differently and will be analysed in future)


<!--
### Spread Analyses in South Americas
Most countries in South Americas recorded many cases, a notable exception is Uruguay with very few cases and only a couple of deaths. The geographic and social situation are hugely different across the Continent. 
All countries provided programs for financial support and additionally:
- Nationwide Quarantines: Argentina, Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile[to Check]
- Stay at home recommendation: Uruguay
- No/few nationwide rules: Brazil 

### Argentina

### Brazil
* The Death Rate is highest in the gov district in capital Brasilia
* the 
-->

### Cities versus Rural
A main distinguishing feature between rural and cities is that in rural areas people are segregated by geographical distance (corresponding a lower population density over entire regions) and thus the time to travel while in cities people tend to be segregated by social factors such as interest/jobs/hobbies/age/world views. The distance separation induces well defined clusters (villages). Social factors yield clusters to but the borders are softer and the clusters are different for each social factor. 
Infectious disease wave through the clusters until there's no more ground to nourish. 

##### rural
  * Segregated by mobility
  * Life is often outdoors or distributed indoor rooms during the day but in the evening the society is tightly connected. 

##### urban
  * not segregated by mobility (but by social factors)
  * life is often indoors but distributed. 
  * People belong to different clusters trough a day 

#### Observations
* In less densely populated provinces (more rural and smaller cities) the Covid-waves are more steep and shorter i.e. the incidence curve is more peaked compared to the incidence curves in large cities. 
  * Observed by [Rader,Scarpino et al](#summary-raderscarpino). 

> I also except that in rural settings: 
> * the peak incidence will be much higher (double or more) and the wave passes through the entire society. 
> * lower death rates (probably 2/3) due to immune systems better adapted to viruses. 

## Population
This section is about how spreaders are distributed in the population and how much risk there's from the various population groups. 

### Spreader Distribution
[in work]

### Children
see section [Schools and Children](#schools-and-children)


## Spread Situations
**[in work]**
Spread situations and patterns of Covid-19 both observed and described in literature.

### Airplanes
[**in work**]
Without good protection measures (masks, ventilation) there have been reported multiple mass transmission events in airplanes [Freedman and Smith](#freedman). Only a couple of cases have been reported seen strong protection measures are in place. 

### Large Scale Production Factories
Around the world in many large scale production factories especially in those preparing food (e.g. meat, bread), large Covid-19 outbreaks among the personal have been observed [citations/sources in work]. 

> Noteworthy that mainly food production factories are concerned. [To check whether they reuse filtered air]

### Large Scale Sporting Events
Large scale sporting events provided likely ground for ultra-spreading events. The evidence for this is currently based on:
* Players and staff were very frequently infected yielding to many cancellations of matches. Infections are very rare in countries with fan bans. 
* the increase of Covid-19 cases seems to be steeper in regions with fans visiting large scale sporting events [to check and verify]

It will be interesting to investigate the prevalence of Covid-19 in the fans either through antigen/PCR ( PCR optimally including sequencing to backtrace the exact transmission pathways) or by studying seroprevalence rates. 

> There's no proof yet as fare as I know. But evidence strong enough to **not allow spectators** anymore in Covid risk regions. 

> While risky I think it was not wrong to have allowed large scale events. Different control measures around the world, some **risking and trying combined with supervising and analyzing help** to understand SARS-CoV-2 including its transmission. 

#### Settings in Sport Stadiums
[**in work**]
* Netherlands: up to 15 - 35% until 1.10. 
* Switzerland:up to 2/3 of capacity [to check] allowed between 1.10.20 and 28.10.20 both for ice hockey (indoor) and football. All fans needed to wear a mask (of any type) but were allowed to drink (including alcoholic beverages).
* Ukraine: allowed in mid October (exact dates to be checked)
* Belgium: up to 400 outdoor and 200 indoor allowed from 23.9. to 23.10.
* Russia: still several thousand fans seem to be allowed in football [as indicated by stadium counts on 4.11.]
* Turkey: several hundred fans seem to be allowed in football [as indicated by stadium counts on 4.11.] [to check]


#### Results from Leagues with Spectators
Sources: https://www.sofascore.com,
https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/scores-fixtures
* Switzerland
  * only 6 out of 12 football games took place between 21.10 and 4.11. The other 6 needed to be cancel due to quarantine of whole teams (multiple infected players and staff members).
  * the regions with ice hockey stadiums most showed a steeper increase in Covid-19 cases than the regions without large ice hockey stadiums. This indicates regular super-spreading events (as fare as I can judge by the data public available) 
  * in late October the majority of hockey matches needed to be cancelled since many teams had multiple infected players.
* Ukraine
  * Shakhtar Donetsk had in early October 2020, 9 infected players and 9 infected staff members 
* Belgium 
  * 4 of 17 matches cancelled between 21.10. and 4.11., despite an increasing Covid prevalence throughout October most matches need to be cancelled in mid October when spectators still were allowed. Nevertheless the cancels can also be due to the overall very high Covid-19 prevalence in Belgium. 
* Turkey 
  * regular cancellation of matches due to insufficient players
* Russia
  * [to check]

#### Results from Leagues without Fans
* UK: between 21.10 and 4.11. all matches (16) have been played
* Netherlands (allowed only until 1.10.): between 21.10. and 4.11. all matches (18) have been played
* Germany: no matches cancelled [to confirm]

### Schools and Children
A recommended review is [COVID-19 Transmission and Children: The Child Is Not to Blame](#leeraszka) by B. Lee and W. Raszka. Notable findings from the studies are below and summaries of most studies are in [Summarized References](#summarized-references).

* [Dattner et al](#summary-dattner) observed that children are relative to adults
  * less susceptible 45% [40%, 55%]) 
  * somewhat less infectious 85% [65%, 110%])
* [Vlachos, Hertegard and Svaleryd](#summary-vlachossvaleryd) found that parents children in the 9th school year (open schools)had about the same incidence rate for Covid-19 as parents children in the 10th school year (closed school). If adjusted for factors such as age and occupation the risk was about 15% higher for being diagnosed with Covid-19 when the child went to open schools. // Comment: this indicate that other factors are more important than whether the children go to school. 
* Large high school outbreak in Israel shortly after reopening of the schools. The outbreak was probably due to aerosol super-spreading from teacher(s) which was enable by densely populated rooms and the permanent use of air-conditioning [Summary Stein-Zamir](#summary-stein-zamir). 
* [Ehrhardt et al](#summary-ehrhardtbrockmann) observed in Baden-Wuertenberg between 19 May to 28 July:
  * 6 of 137 likely infectious pupils actually infected other a total of 11 other pupils (an R value contribution of below .1)
  * 3% of infections of children (0-19 year) could be traced back to schools. Where as 41% to families and 8% to festivals/events.
* [Perez-Lopez et al](#summary-perez-lopez) published statistics about viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from visits in Sidra Medicine, the main pediatric center in Qatar. They observed a significant 30 fold reduction for influenza A. A 30% reduction was observed for influenza B and Common HCoVs. //Comment: Their observations indicate that in school settings only the influenza A transmission is efficient and other viruses are transmitted mainly outside of schools. This in turn indicates that for most viruses adults play the major role in the transmission.

#### Methods
"We investigated data from severe acute respira- tory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected 0–19year olds, who attended schools/childcare facili- ties, to assess their role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission after these establishments’ reopening in May 2020 in Baden-Württemberg, Germany."
#### School Setting
50% Group Size: Yes, Cleaning of Surface: Yes, Regular Ventilation: Yes, Hygiene: Yes, Face Mask in Break: Some, Face Mask in Classroom: No, Physical Distancing: Some, No Singing: Most, Physical Education: No
#### Results
* Infection by pupils
  1. Total of 557 Covid-19 cases in the age group 0-19 year out of a total of 3104 cases in Badenwuertenberg in the study period (19.5-25.7)
  2. For 453 School attendance information was available
  3. 137 (30% of 453) were at least 1 day at school while infectious 
  4. 11 other pupils were infected by 6 of those 137
  5. no secondary infection from those 11 were detected despite extensive contact tracing
* only 15 (3%) of 453 infected children (with school attendance known) were infected in schools (the 11 above from other pupils and 4 by teachers). Most infections occurred in families or festivals/events (Table 2).


### Summary Vlachos,Svaleryd
**School closures and SARS-CoV-2. Evidence from Sweden’s partial school closure**
Jonas Vlachos, Edvin Hertegard, Helena Svaleryd
#### Methods
Remark: Working Paper
* "Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions."
* the incidence rates were adjusted using logistic regression for wage, sex, occupation, educational attainment, income, regions of residence and of origin. OLS was used too. 
#### Results
* Comparison of Covid-19 incidences between parents with children in schools and homeschooling:
  * unadjusted the Covid incidence were near the same 5.67 versus 5.66 (Table 2)
  * adjusted the risk for parents with children in school was about 15% [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03–1.27] higher if adjusted with logistic regression(Table 1)
* "Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52–2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00–1.68]."
> #### Comment
> It is not clear that the observed slightly increased Covid incidence of parents/teachers of lower secondary school children results from transmission from the children, it could also be attributed to parents visiting the school and a following transmission between adults.

#### Methods
Analyzing a large high school out break in Israel shortly after schools have been reopened. 
#### School Setting
* From 13 March to 17 May Schools in Israel were closed (limited opening for small children on 3 May)
* A heat wave with temperatures up to 40 degree from 19–21 May: 
  * "air-conditioning functioned continuously in all classes."
  * no face-masks
* "crowded classes: 35–38 students per class, class area 39–49 m2, allowing 1.1–1.3 m2 per student"
#### Results
* "Testing of the complete school community revealed 153 students (attack rate: 13.2%) and 25 staff members (attack rate: 16.6%) who were COVID-19 positive."
* "COVID-19 rates were higher in junior grades (7–9) than in high grades (10–12) (Figure 1). The peak rates were observed in the 9th grade (20 cases in one class and 13 cases in two other classes) and the 7th grade (14 cases in one class). Of the cases in teachers, four taught all these four classes, two taught three of the four classes and one taught two of these four classes."
* "Most student cases presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic."


### Summary Dattner
**The role of children in the spread of COVID-19: Using household data from Bnei Brak, Israel, to estimate the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children**
Remark: **not** peer-reviewed
#### Methods
* "Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak (City close to Tel Aviv), Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR."
* The authors developed a model (discrete stochastic dynamic model) for the propagation of Covid within a household. With this model infectivity and susceptibility for children and adults can be estimated. 
#### Findings
* 44% of adults and 25% of children infected
* infection risk increases with age (except children below 1 year compared to children between 1 and 4)
* For children the susceptibility was 45% [40%, 55%] and the infectivity 85% [65%, 110%] in comparison to adults.

Rader, B., Scarpino, S.V., Nande, A. et al.
Nat Med (2020). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1104-0]()

#### Goal
Figure out the effect of population densities (crowding), mobility, humidity on the overall and the temporal distribution of Covid-19 incidences. 

#### Methods
The incidence rates of Covid was analysed in China and Italy.
Their work consists of two parts: 
1. A spread analysis, using various statistical methods.
     * Regions which published independent Covid cases were considered as units. In China these were provinces [to confirm]. 
     * For each unit the population density is determined.
     * To measure how peaky the incidence curves are, Shannon entropy is calculated. 
2. The spread is simulated. The simulation is done for different population models [to check].

#### 1. Analysis Results
* lower density = sparse (rural areas): 
  * more peaked incidence rates, most of the infections are within 20 days (Figure 1a)
  * lower cumulative incidence (final attack rate)
* high density = crowded (large cities): 
  * less peaked incidence rates, most of the cases are within 40 days (Figure 1a)
  * higher cumulative incidence rates
#### 2. Simulation Results
* lower density = sparse: 
  * intervention measures cause the incidence curve to flatten out and moderately reduce total case count (Figure 3 c and d)
* high density = crowded: 
  * intervention measures are crucial since without interventions prolonged spread with high numbers of infected is predicted (Figure 3 c and d)
