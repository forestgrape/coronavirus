## Introduction
### Goal
The goal is to better understand the spread of Covid-19 to be able to determine the optimal measures.

### Methods
* Analysis is based on literature and directly analyzing published Covid-19 cases data. 
* The spread observed for Covid-19 is analysed.
* The spread is compared to the observed spread for other diseases. 


## Observed Spread Patterns
[in work]
* In less densely populated provinces (more rural and smaller cities) the Covid-waves are more steep and shorter i.e. the incidence curve is more peaked compared to the incidence curves in large cities. 
  * Observed by [Rader,Scarpino et al](#summary-raderscarpino).

#### Goal
Figure out the effect of population densities (crowding), mobility, humidity on the overall and the temporal distribution of Covid-19 incidences. 

#### Methods
The incidence rates of Covid was analysed in China and Italy.
There work consists of two parts: 
1. A spread analysis, using various statistical methods.
     * Regions which published independent Covid cases were considered as units. In China these were provinces [to confirm]. 
     * For each unit the population density is determined.
     * To measure how peaky the incidence curves are, their Shannon entropy is calculated. 
2. The spread was simulated. The simulation was done for different population models and with 


#### Analysis Results
* lower density = sparse (rural areas): 
  * more peaked incidence rates, most of the infections are within 20 days (Figure 1a)
  * lower cumulative incidence (final attack rate)
* high density = crowded (large cities): 
  * less peaked incidence rates, most of the cases are within 40 days (Figure 1a)
  * higher cumulative incidence rates

#### Simulation Results
* lower density = sparse: 
  * intervention measures cause the incidence curve to flatten out and moderately reduce total case count (Figure 3 c and d)
* high density = crowded: 
  * intervention measures are crucial since without interventions prolonged spread with high numbers of infected is predicted (Figure 3 c and d)
