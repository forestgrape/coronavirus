## Introduction
### Goal
The goal is to better understand the spread of Covid-19 to be able to determine the optimal measures.

### Methods
* Analysis is based on literature and directly analyzing published Covid-19 cases data. 
* The spread observed for Covid-19 is analysed.
* The spread is compared to the observed spread for other diseases. 


## Observed Spread Patterns
[in work]
* In less densely populated provinces (more rural and smaller cities) the Covid-waves are more steep and shorter i.e. the incidence curve is more peaked compared to the incidence curves in large cities. 
  * Observed by [Rader,Scarpino et al](#summary-raderscarpino).
* Large high school outbreak in Israel shortly after reopening of the schools. The outbreak was probably due to aerosol super-spreading from teacher(s) which was enable by use air-conditioning [Summary Stein-Zamir](#summary-stein-zamir).

### Summary Stein-Zamir
**A large COVID-19 outbreak in a high school 10 days after schools’ reopening, Israel, May 2020.**

#### Methods
Analyzing a large high school out break in Israel shortly after schools have been reopened. 
#### School Setting
* From 13 March to 17 May Schools in Israel were closed (limited opening for small children on 3 May)
* From 19–21 May a heat wave occurred: 
  * air-conditioning functioned continuously in all classes.
  * no face-masks
* "crowded classes: 35–38 students per class, class area 39–49 m2, allowing 1.1–1.3 m2 per student"

#### Results
* "Testing of the complete school community revealed 153 students (attack rate: 13.2%) and 25 staff members (attack rate: 16.6%) who were COVID-19 positive."
* "COVID-19 rates were higher in junior grades (7–9) than in high grades (10–12) (Figure 1). The peak rates were observed in the 9th grade (20 cases in one class and 13 cases in two other classes) and the 7th grade (14 cases in one class). Of the cases in teachers, four taught all these four classes, two taught three of the four classes and one taught two of these four classes."
* "Most student cases presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic."

#### Goal
Figure out the effect of population densities (crowding), mobility, humidity on the overall and the temporal distribution of Covid-19 incidences. 

#### Methods
The incidence rates of Covid was analysed in China and Italy.
There work consists of two parts: 
1. A spread analysis, using various statistical methods.
     * Regions which published independent Covid cases were considered as units. In China these were provinces [to confirm]. 
     * For each unit the population density is determined.
     * To measure how peaky the incidence curves are, their Shannon entropy is calculated. 
2. The spread was simulated. The simulation was done for different population models and with 


#### Analysis Results
* lower density = sparse (rural areas): 
  * more peaked incidence rates, most of the infections are within 20 days (Figure 1a)
  * lower cumulative incidence (final attack rate)
* high density = crowded (large cities): 
  * less peaked incidence rates, most of the cases are within 40 days (Figure 1a)
  * higher cumulative incidence rates

#### Simulation Results
* lower density = sparse: 
  * intervention measures cause the incidence curve to flatten out and moderately reduce total case count (Figure 3 c and d)
* high density = crowded: 
  * intervention measures are crucial since without interventions prolonged spread with high numbers of infected is predicted (Figure 3 c and d)
