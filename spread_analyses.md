## Summary
[Situations with Covid-19 spreading](#spread-situations) is observed or is *not* observed are described and analysed.
### Covid Transmission happens when much Air is Exchanged between People
Covid-19 transmission correlates to the amount of air people breadth from each other.
The amount of exchanged air is high 
* indoors air with bad ventilation (either heated or air-conditioned) 
* increased inhaling
  * being at low air pressure (either high altitude or airplane) 
  * activities such as singing, shouting or strains e.g. sports
  
The correlation to the amount of air exchanged is expected if the transmission model is a generalized aerosol transmission model (either aerosol or dry form transmission [Summary Airborne Transmission](./transmission.md#summary-airborne-transmission)). For the droplet transmission model the distance and speaking method would be expected to matter most. 
Regarding prevention measures the takeaway is, that transmission increases with the amount of air exchanged. The exact transmission mechanism may provide additional insights and help fine-tuning but mostly it can be abstracted away.
### Observations supporting the Air Exchange Hypothesis
Observations indicating that the Covid-19 transmission correlates to inhaled and exhaled air:
* [Geographical Analysis](#geographical-analysis): Covid-19 waves across the world are predated by uncomfortable climate conditions (sometimes to hot but mostly to cold). 
* [Large Scale Sporting Events](#large-scale-sporting-events) In sports clubs where spectators are/were allowed to the stadiums, the players have a much higher risks to get infected with Covid-19 than in regions without spectators. Moreover Covid-19 incidence rates seem to be higher in areas with large scale sport events (especially indoor). 
* [Airplanes](#airplanes): High spread rates observed without adequate prevention measures (mask, ventilation). 
* [Large Scale Production Factories](#large-scale-production-factories): Multiple large outbreaks observed mainly in food production factories around the world.
* Dense living conditions in comfortable climate or in regions where air-conditioners are not widespread
* Limited access to water for washing hands alone don't yield an increased spread of Covid-19. 


### The Susceptibility and Infectiousness varies across People and depends on Biological Factors
The susceptibility and infectiousness are correlated and depend on factors such as age, BMI, sex ...
* [Schools and Children](#schools-and-children)
Children less susceptible to infection and they spread Covid less than adults. 
*  Women are less infectious than men (observed for influenza and the generation of aerosol) [refs coming]
* [Population](#population): Analyzing the spread across people: 20% are responsible for 80% of the infections [**in work**].

## Geographical Analysis
[in work]

### Climate and Covid-19 Spread
Observations indicating that the Covid-19 transmission correlates to inhaled and exhaled air:  Covid-19 waves across the world are predated by situations which favour time spent indoors and bad ventilation. Such situations are cold outside climate (Northern countries in Winter, high altitude), hot outside climate (close to the  Tropics combined with prevalence of air-conditioning e.g. Los Angeles, Florida and Arizona in Southern US, Brazil), in some cases stay at home orders and sometimes spread is increased by cities at high altitude (above 2000 meters: Mexico City, La Paz in Bolivia, Quito in Ecuador, Bogota in Colombia and winter sport locations in the Alps and Rocky Mountains) which increases the amount of air inhaled. 


<!--
For regions across the world the following is analysed:
* Covid-19 cases and deaths to find Covid-waves i.e. time spans with increased spread
* geographical, climate and social situations including measures to flatten/prevent Covid 
  * while cases increase i.e. during the Covid-19 waves 
  * while Covid-19 decrease or stay low despite having a relevant population of possible Covid spreaders (the spread in regions with very low case count where contact tracing can work, behave differently and will be analysed in future)



### Spread Analyses in South Americas
Most countries in South Americas recorded many cases, a notable exception is Uruguay with very few cases and only a couple of deaths. The geographic and social situation are hugely different across the Continent. 
All countries provided programs for financial support and additionally:
- Nationwide Quarantines: Argentina, Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile[to Check]
- Stay at home recommendation: Uruguay
- No/few nationwide rules: Brazil 

### Argentina

### Brazil
* The Death Rate is highest in the gov district in capital Brasilia

-->

### Cities versus Rural
A main distinguishing feature between rural and cities is that in rural areas people are segregated by geographical distance (corresponding a lower population density over entire regions) and thus the time to travel while in cities people tend to be segregated by social factors such as interest/jobs/hobbies/age/world views. The distance separation induces well defined clusters (villages). Social factors yield clusters to but the borders are softer and the clusters are different for each social factor. 
Infectious disease wave through the clusters until there's no more ground to nourish. 

##### Rural
  * Segregated by mobility
  * Life is often outdoors or distributed indoor rooms during the day but in the evening the society is tightly connected. 

##### Urban
  * not segregated by mobility (but by social factors) which yields a different segmentation for each factor
  * life is often indoors but distributed. 
  * People belong to different clusters trough a day 

#### Observations
* In less densely populated provinces (more rural and smaller cities) the Covid-waves are more steep and shorter i.e. the incidence curve is more peaked compared to the incidence curves in large cities. 
  * Observed by [Rader,Scarpino et al](#summary-raderscarpino). 

> I also except that in rural settings: 
> * the peak incidence will be much higher (double or more) and the wave passes through the entire society in one go. 
> * lower death rates (probably 2/3) due to immune systems better adapted to viruses. 


### Living Conditions
People in neighborhoods in cities with small living areas and a low incomes are more frequently infected and contribute above average to the spread of Covid. Small living space is correlated to low income which in turn is correlated to jobs where home office is less possible (e.g. service)  
* [Brueningk et al](#summary-brueningk) deduce from Covid-19 spread from SARS-2 genome sequencing: Small living space (and low incomes) are key factors for increased spread. 
* [Lundkvist et al](#lundkvist) observe that in Stockholm people living in suburbs with large buildings built in the 60s have a seroprevalence of 30%, compared to a seroprevalence of 4% for people living in modern building (likely some form of ventilation is built in). 

## Infectors
Knowing how infectors are distributed, can help to fine-tune control measures. 

### Infector Distribution
Contact tracing in Hong Kong revealed that [Adam et al](#summary-adamwu):
* 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
* 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
* 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in 

### Infectors and Symptom Status
[**in work**]
> // Caveat: Most of the investigation were done early in 2020 when only few strains of SARS-CoV-2 may have been able to diminish the immune system enough to cause asymptomatic infections. Back then over 80% developed symptoms. 
* [Adam et al](#summary-adamwu) found only 2.2% (7 in 309) of the infections were caused by pre-symptomatic people. Caveat: 
* The two mass infection events observed in airplanes were both caused by symptomatic infectors [Freedman and Wilder-Smith](#freedman). 
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that in household settings symptomatic infectors cause about 3 times as many infections as pre/asymptomatic infectors. 

### Children
Children are less likely to be infectees and less likely to be infectors [see section [Schools and Children](#schools-and-children)].
 

## Spread Situations
**[in work]**
Spread situations and patterns of Covid-19 both observed and described in literature. Nearly all observed spread events are indoors, except football matches with visitors. 

### Indoor Social Settings
* [Contact Tracing in Hong Kong](#summary-adamwu) revealed that transmission in social settings (bars, weddings, temples) was associated with more secondary cases than households.

### Airplanes
[**in work**]
[Freedman and Wilder-Smith](#freedman) is a concise review about the knowledge on airplane transmission as of September 2020. Table 1 in their paper summarizes all studies the studies they reviewed. 
Key points:
* "In-flight transmission of SARS-CoV had previously been demonstrated during the symptomatic but not asymptomatic phase of illness. In 2003, up to 22 transmissions occurred on a single f light from a single index case;1 conversely, several other carefully stud- ied flights resulted in no transmission."
* For SARS-2 two super-spreading events (more than 10 transmissions) have been observed. Both in March when no strong protection measures were in place. Both index cases were symptomatic. 
* Since strong protection measures are in place only few transmissions have been observed. 
* Protection measures in airplanes:
  * Screens for symptoms at boarding time (asymptomatic patients have been frequently overlooked but they rarely caused transmissions.
  * masks (mostly permanent but often meals are served)
  * Ventilation is not mentioned in the paper from [Freedman and Wilder-Smith](#freedman), see [Ventilation in Airplanes](#ventilation-in-airplanes)

#### Ventilation in Airplanes
Ventilation:  Airlines seem to have optimized ventilation to have a high air exchange (20 times per hour) and the air flow is from top to bottom (and not anymore from front to back) [citations in work].


### Large Scale Production Factories
Around the world in many large scale production factories especially in those preparing food (e.g. meat, bread), large Covid-19 outbreaks among the personal have been observed [citations/sources in work].

> Noteworthy that often food production factories are concerned. [To check whether they reuse filtered air and what temperature/humidity settings]

### Large Scale Sporting Events
Large scale sporting events provided likely ground for ultra-spreading events. The evidence for this is currently based on:
* Players and staff were very frequently infected yielding to many cancellations of matches. Infections are very rare in countries with fan bans. 
* the increase of Covid-19 cases seems to be steeper in regions with spectators visiting large scale sporting events [to check and verify]

It will be interesting to investigate the prevalence of Covid-19 in the spectators either through antigen/PCR (PCR: ideally whole genome sequencing to backtrace the transmission pathways) or by studying seroprevalence rates. 

> There's no proof yet as fare as I know. But evidence strong enough to **not allow spectators** anymore in Covid risk regions. 

> In epidemiology too: **Courageously exploring and trying combined with measurements, consideration and analyses help** to understand SARS-CoV-2 including its transmission. 

#### Settings in Sport Stadiums
[**in work**]
* Netherlands: up to 15 - 35% until 1.10. 
* Switzerland:up to 2/3 of capacity [to check] allowed between 1.10.20 and 28.10.20 both for ice hockey (indoor) and football. All fans needed to wear a mask (of any type) but were allowed to drink (including alcoholic beverages).
* Ukraine: allowed in mid October (exact dates to be checked)
* Belgium: up to 400 outdoor and 200 indoor allowed from 23.9. to 23.10.
* Russia: still several thousand fans seem to be allowed in football [as indicated by stadium counts on 4.11.]
* Turkey: several hundred fans seem to be allowed in football [as indicated by stadium counts on 4.11.] [to check]
* UK: After a 4 week lockdown which ended on 2nd December 2020 until 5.1.2021 ([Appendix UK Sport Data](#data-uk-sport-events)):
  4000 spectators in Tier 1 (about 10%-15% of capacity)
  2000 spectators in Tier 2 (about 5%-7.5% of capacity)
  0 spectators in Tier 3
  until 5th of January 2021 when a new lockdown was started.


#### Results from Leagues with Spectators
Sources: [https://www.sofascore.com](),
[https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/scores-fixtures](), [https://www.srf.ch/sports]()
* Netherlands
  * A very steep increase of Covid-19 cases in early October
* Switzerland
  * only 6 out of 12 football games took place between 21.10 and 4.11. The other 6 needed to be cancel due to quarantine of whole teams (multiple infected players and staff members). Some teams had most of their players and staff infected. 
  * the regions with ice hockey stadiums most showed a steeper increase in Covid-19 cases than the regions without ice hockey stadiums. This indicates regular super-spreading events (as fare as I can judge by the data public available). 
  * in late October the majority of hockey matches needed to be cancelled since many teams had multiple infected players.
* Ukraine:
  Shakhtar Donetsk had in early October 2020, 9 infected players and 9 infected staff members. [other teams to be checked]
* Belgium 
  * 4 of 17 matches cancelled between 21.10. and 4.11., despite an increasing Covid prevalence throughout October most matches need to be cancelled until mid October when spectators still were allowed. Nevertheless the cancels can also be due to the overall very high Covid-19 prevalence in Belgium. 
* Turkey 
  regular cancellation of matches due to insufficient players 
* Russia
  [to check]
* UK (Period 3.12. - 5.1.) ([Appendix UK Sport Data](#data-uk-sport-events))
  * Multiple match cancellation.
  * A steep increase in case counts. // before 3.12. there was a lockdown/shutdown and after pubs and restaurants were reopened in most regions but unlikely sport events played a role since only a couple of thousands spectators across the country
  * An increase in infected players. However the increase in infected players is only slightly steeper than the general case count increase.
    * 23.11. - 13.12:  30 (3 Weeks; 3 Rounds)
    * 21.12 - 10.1.: 94 (3 Weeks; 4 Rounds; some matches cancelled and these high risk teams likely not tested)
  * // Some evidence that spectators increased the number of infected players. Even though there were some matches cancelled, the increase in infected players was not much steeper than the general case count. However in september/october/november the correlation between case counts and infected players is rather low. 



#### Results from Leagues without Fans
* UK (no spectators until 2.12.): between 21.10. and 4.11. all matches (16) have been played
* Netherlands (allowed only until 1.10.): between 21.10. and 4.11. all matches (18) have been played
* Germany: no matches cancelled [to confirm]

### Schools and Children
A recommended review is [COVID-19 Transmission and Children: The Child Is Not to Blame](#leeraszka) by B. Lee and W. Raszka. Notable findings from the studies are below and summaries of most studies are in [Summarized References](#summarized-references).

* [Dattner et al](#summary-dattner) observed that children are relative to adults
  * less susceptible 45% [40%, 55%]) 
  * somewhat less infectious 85% [65%, 110%])
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that children are only about half as likely to get infected in households compared to adults (spouses which are most likely to get infected)
* [Vlachos, Hertegard and Svaleryd](#summary-vlachossvaleryd) found that parents children in the 9th school year (open schools)had about the same incidence rate for Covid-19 as parents children in the 10th school year (closed school). If adjusted for factors such as age and occupation the risk was about 15% higher for being diagnosed with Covid-19 when the child went to open schools. // Comment: this indicate that other factors are more important than whether the children go to school. 
* Large high school outbreak in Israel shortly after reopening of the schools. The outbreak was probably due to aerosol super-spreading from teacher(s) which was enable by densely populated rooms and the permanent use of air-conditioning [Summary Stein-Zamir](#summary-stein-zamir). 
* [Ehrhardt et al](#summary-ehrhardtbrockmann) observed in Baden-Wuertenberg between 19 May to 28 July:
  * 6 of 137 infected pupils infected a total of 11 other pupils (an R value contribution of below .1)
  * 3% of infections of children (0-19 year) could be traced back to schools. Where as 41% to families and 8% to festivals/events.
* [Perez-Lopez et al](#summary-perez-lopez) published statistics about viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from visits in Sidra Medicine, the main pediatric center in Qatar. They observed a significant 30 fold reduction for influenza A. A 30% reduction was observed for influenza B and Common HCoVs. //Comment: Their observations indicate that in school settings only the influenza A transmission is efficient and other viruses are transmitted mainly in setting other than schools. This in turn indicates that for most viruses adults play the major role in the transmission.

### Comments on Spread Analysis
* only when Covid prevalence is very low, infected household members directly indicate secondary attack rate [Comments at [Summary Madewell](#summary-madewell)]


### Summary Madewell
**Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary attack rate**
Zachary J. Madewell, Yang Yang, Ira M. Longini Jr, M. Elizabeth Halloran, Natalie E. Dean
medRxiv preprint doi: [https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164590](), posted August 1, 2020.
#### Methods
Meta-Analysis of studies regarding the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in household settings. Many different kind of studies are included: * Covid diagnosis based on RT-PCR, whole-genome sequencing, nucleic acid tests, antibody tests and some studies included symptoms. 
* The influence of the different factors (contact type, symptom status, adult/child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, index case sex, number of contacts in household, coronavirus) is analyzed.

#### Findings
Secondary Attach Rates with different groups as **infectors**. The error rate is in brackets. 
* household: 0.19 (0.4); family including non household contacts: 0.18 (0.5)
* symptomatic: 0.2 (0.6); pre- or asymptomatic: 0.07 (0.04)

Secondary Attach Rates with different groups as **infectees**. The error rate is in brackets. 
* children: 0.16 (0.6); adults: 0.31 (1.2) // adults includes spouses
* spouse: 0.43 (1.6); other: 1.8 (0.8)

Proportion of households where a secondary transmission was observed:
* 0.32 (.025)

Comparison with SARS-1 or MERS:
* SARS-1: 0.06 (0.04)
* MERS: 0.035 (0.035)


> #### Comments
> * Studies from countries with high and very high Covid prevalence are included too, in these countries independent infections pathways for several household members are likely and thus the prevalence is likely higher than the secondary attack rate. 




### Summary Adam,Wu
**Clustering and superspreading potential of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Hong Kong**
Adam D, Wu P, Wong J, et al. Research Square; 2020. [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-29548/v1]()
#### Methods
"Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection."
#### Results
* Distribution of Infectivity:
  * 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
  * 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
  * 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in quarantine, Fig.2)
* "Gatherings in social settings such as bars, restaurants, weddings and religious sites appear to be at increased risk of superspreading events."
* "Transmission in social settings was significantly associated with an increased number of secondary cases compared to transmission observed in family households."
* Quarantine
  * Home quarantine yielded sporadic infections (2 observed) in family settings (Fig.2 d) and none outside families
  * Government quarantine yielded no further infections (Fig.2)
* "Of all cases confirmed in Hong Kong, 195 (18.8%, 195/1,038) were asymptomatic at confirmation (Supplementary Table 2) and, of these, most (83.1%, 162/195) were PCR-confirmed from 27 March onward" (Extended Data Fig.2)
* Infections caused by pre-symptomatic infectors were rarely observed: "Seven instances of likely pre-symptomatic transmission were observed where onset of the infectee preceded that of the infector or occurred on the same day."
#### Limitations
"These findings take advantage of the quality of case ascertainment and contact tracing data in Hong Kong, although some incompleteness in links between cases could potentially bias our estimates of transmission heterogeneity."

#### Methods
"We investigated data from severe acute respira- tory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected 0–19year olds, who attended schools/childcare facili- ties, to assess their role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission after these establishments’ reopening in May 2020 in Baden-Württemberg, Germany."
#### School Setting
50% Group Size: Yes, Cleaning of Surface: Yes, Regular Ventilation: Yes, Hygiene: Yes, Face Mask in Break: Some, Face Mask in Classroom: No, Physical Distancing: Some, No Singing: Most, Physical Education: No
#### Results
* Infection by pupils
  1. Total of 557 Covid-19 cases in the age group 0-19 year out of a total of 3104 cases in Badenwuertenberg in the study period (19.5-25.7)
  2. For 453 School attendance information was available
  3. 137 (30% of 453) were at least 1 day at school while infectious 
  4. 11 other pupils were infected by 6 of those 137
  5. no secondary infection from those 11 were detected despite extensive contact tracing
* only 15 (3%) of 453 infected children (with school attendance known) were infected in schools (the 11 above from other pupils and 4 by teachers). Most infections occurred in families or festivals/events (Table 2).


### Summary Vlachos,Svaleryd
**School closures and SARS-CoV-2. Evidence from Sweden’s partial school closure**
Jonas Vlachos, Edvin Hertegard, Helena Svaleryd
#### Methods
Remark: Working Paper
* "Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions."
* the incidence rates were adjusted using logistic regression for wage, sex, occupation, educational attainment, income, regions of residence and of origin. OLS was used too. 
#### Results
* Comparison of Covid-19 incidences between parents with children in schools and homeschooling:
  * unadjusted the Covid incidence were near the same 5.67 versus 5.66 (Table 2)
  * adjusted the risk for parents with children in school was about 15% [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03–1.27] higher if adjusted with logistic regression(Table 1)
* "Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52–2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00–1.68]."
> #### Comment
> It is not clear that the observed slightly increased Covid incidence of parents/teachers of lower secondary school children results from transmission from the children, it could also be attributed to parents visiting the school and a following transmission between adults.

#### Methods
Analyzing a large high school out break in Israel shortly after schools have been reopened. 
#### School Setting
* From 13 March to 17 May Schools in Israel were closed (limited opening for small children on 3 May)
* A heat wave with temperatures up to 40 degree from 19–21 May: 
  * "air-conditioning functioned continuously in all classes."
  * no face-masks
* "crowded classes: 35–38 students per class, class area 39–49 m2, allowing 1.1–1.3 m2 per student"
#### Results
* "Testing of the complete school community revealed 153 students (attack rate: 13.2%) and 25 staff members (attack rate: 16.6%) who were COVID-19 positive."
* "COVID-19 rates were higher in junior grades (7–9) than in high grades (10–12) (Figure 1). The peak rates were observed in the 9th grade (20 cases in one class and 13 cases in two other classes) and the 7th grade (14 cases in one class). Of the cases in teachers, four taught all these four classes, two taught three of the four classes and one taught two of these four classes."
* "Most student cases presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic."


### Summary Dattner
**The role of children in the spread of COVID-19: Using household data from Bnei Brak, Israel, to estimate the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children**
Remark: **not** peer-reviewed
#### Methods
* "Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak (City close to Tel Aviv), Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR."
* The authors developed a model (discrete stochastic dynamic model) for the propagation of Covid within a household. With this model infectivity and susceptibility for children and adults can be estimated. 
#### Findings
* 44% of adults and 25% of children infected
* infection risk increases with age (except children below 1 year compared to children between 1 and 4)
* For children the susceptibility was 45% [40%, 55%] and the infectivity 85% [65%, 110%] in comparison to adults.

#### Goal
Figure out the effect of population densities (crowding), mobility, humidity on the overall and the temporal distribution of Covid-19 incidences. 

#### Methods
The incidence rates of Covid was analysed in China and Italy.
Their work consists of two parts: 
1. A spread analysis, using various statistical methods.
     * Regions which published independent Covid cases were considered as units. In China these were provinces [to confirm]. 
     * For each unit the population density is determined.
     * To measure how peaky the incidence curves are, Shannon entropy is calculated. 
2. The spread is simulated. The simulation is done for different population models [to check].

#### 1. Analysis Results
* lower density = sparse (rural areas): 
  * more peaked incidence rates, most of the infections are within 20 days (Figure 1a)
  * lower cumulative incidence (final attack rate)
* high density = crowded (large cities): 
  * less peaked incidence rates, most of the cases are within 40 days (Figure 1a)
  * higher cumulative incidence rates
#### 2. Simulation Results
* lower density = sparse: 
  * intervention measures cause the incidence curve to flatten out and moderately reduce total case count (Figure 3 c and d)
* high density = crowded: 
  * intervention measures are crucial since without interventions prolonged spread with high numbers of infected is predicted (Figure 3 c and d)

##### Methods
"The prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies on June 17–18, 2020 was investigated in two residential areas of Stockholm, Sweden."
##### Results
In Norra Djurgårdsstaden, modern residential blocks in the upper price class, 4.1% of study participants had SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In Tensta a suburb with low cost apartments in large residential blocks (built in the 60s and 70s), 30% of the participants tested antibody positive.

##### Methods
The influence of 4 socioeconomic factors (Living space per person, Median Income, 1-person households, Seniority) on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is analysed based on sequence data and computer simulation. In a second step, the effect of reduced transmissibility of population subgroups on the spread of Covid is simulated. 

>  The term vaccinated is used in the paper but since it is unknown (as of 27.1.2021) whether the available vaccines produce a useful immunity regarding transmission and there are other methods (e.g. testing, masks, natural immunity) to reduce transmissibility the term reduced transmissibility is used here.

##### Methods Details
* Sequence Information: "In total 247 cases within the time period from the 25th of February until the 22nd of April were included in this analysis. For all data a seven day moving window average was taken to account for reporting bias on weekends, and cumulative numbers of infected cases (compartment I) were calculated."
* Simulation: "SEIR-model. Similar to previous work [20, 52, 53] the spread of the epidemic within the city of Basel was described using a compartmental two-arm SEIR model including both sequenced, and unsequencend/unreported cases."
* Serology: "We determined SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in a total of 2,019 serum samples collected from individuals between 25th of February and 22nd of May, 2020, to account for sero-conversion. The cohorts included healthy blood donors and patients from the University Hospital Basel with residency in Basel-City, and Viollier AG Zurich, a lab medicine provider contracted for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing."

##### Results
People belonging to the thirds with the smallest living space per person have the largest pre-lockdown effective reproductive number (shown in Figure 3). Similarly people in the lowest income (which is likely well correlated to the living space) have a high reproductive number. Reducing the transmissibility of the people belonging to the lowest living space third or the lowest income third reduces and delays the maximal icu occupancy (Figure 7).

##### Results Details
* Mobility:
  * "We observe that low and median income populations are more mobile than their wealthier counterparts. Moreover, there is little mobility within areas with a low share of 1-person households, a result of the predominantly peripheral location of the relevant statistical blocks (see Figure S5). For living space per person or percentage of senior citizens, mobility was comparable between tertiles with a trend towards higher mobility within the younger population groups."
  * "For living space per person or percentage of senior citizens, mobility was comparable
146 between tertiles with a trend towards higher mobility within the younger population groups."
* "We found that blocks with a higher median income (2% achieved significance), or higher living space per person (1% achieved significance), or lower share of 1-person households (2% achieved significance) had a significantly lower Ref f (< 1.7) relative to the maximum Ref f observed in the relevant partition."
* "Serology information was used to estimate the fraction of unreported cases as follows: An estimated 1.88% (38/2,019) of the Basel-City population was infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of these 60% would be attributed to the B.1-C15324T strain, leading to a percentage of 88% of unreported/unsequenced cases to consider."

Science 362 (6410), 75-79. [https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat6030]()

##### Methods
* " However, the role of city size and structure in shaping transmission patterns of seasonal influenza is not well understood. We address this here using 6 years (2002 to 2008) of data on weekly incidence of influenza- like illness (ILI) in 603 three-digit postal (ZIP) codes across the United States, assembled from medical claims data (34)."
##### Results
* "We find that differences in nj among cities persist across years—some cities have consistently more intense epidemics than others, year after year. "
* "Cities with higher mean intensity tend to be located in the east, have smaller population sizes, and have higher-amplitude seasonal fluctuations in specific humidity." (Fig 1 D-F)
* "Increasing base transmission potential can decrease epidemic intensity in a seasonally forced compartmental epidemic model." (Fig 2)
* Population size and crowding increase the base transmission potential. (Fig 3 F,G)
