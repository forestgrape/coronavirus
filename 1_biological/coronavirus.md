Various aspects of coronaviruses are described with a focus on understanding. We start with first principles: life forms on earth. Viruses are defined as life forms which are dependent on extern enzymes and aspects such as life cycle and movement options are sketched. Finally we have a look at coronaviruses with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.

## Introduction to Life

### Life Forms

> ###### Life Form
> A *life form* in a given environment is an identifiable thing that can interact and influence parts of its environment and thereby produce things which are near the same and thus have near the same interaction patterns. These are called *progeny* or *next generation*.

In other words, a form of live has memorized environment interactions and passes rough copies of those memories to the next generation.

All known forms of life on earth interact with the environment at the molecular level on the basis of enzymes made of RNA and proteins (only RNA in the case of [viroids](#viroid)), which catalyze interactions in watery solutions. 

The simplest forms of life are viroids. 
> ###### Viroid
> *Viroids* are pieces of RNA able catalyze self reproduction. 

All other known forms of life also encode enzymes made of proteins.
> ###### Protein
> *Proteins* are amino acids chained together.

Proteins are assembled by ribosomes:
> ###### Ribosome
> ###### mRNA
> ###### Translation
> *Ribosomes* read positive sense RNA, called *messenger RNA* or just *mRNA*, and select a amino acid for each triple of RNA acids and chain these amino acids together to proteins. This process is called *translation* since the mRNA is translated to a protein.


### Lifetime Storage
[in work] As noted above form of life have to ability to memorize environment interactions. 4 forms of lifetime storage are known to be used on todays earth. 

* ##### ssRNA
    single stranded RNA:
    - unstable 
    - difficult to reliably duplicate, recombination possible
* ##### dsRNA
    double stranded RNA: 
    - somewhat unstable
    - somewhat reliable duplication possible
* ##### ssDNA
    single stranded DNA: 
    - difficult to reliable duplicate, recombination possible
    - mediocre stability
* ##### dsDNA
    double stranded DNA: 
    - very stable
    - reliable duplication possible 

#### Notes on Storage
* only dsDNA forms are able to encode all enzymes for their entire metabolism and are able do photosynthesis on todays earth. All other life forms are dependent on some enzymes produced by dsDNA forms and are called [viruses](#virus).
* Some forms of life alternate the storage formats through their life cycle: ssRNA-RT (retroviruses).
 

### Storage and Duplication Options
[in work]

#### 1 Form using RNA only

> ##### Viroid
> Viroids = single RNA strand which catalyzes its duplication

#### 7 Forms using Proteins
7 forms of combinations of lifetime storage and duplication/decode mechanisms are known to be in use on earth, known as Baltimore classification:
* (+)ssRNA = Single stranded RNA, + sense
    - genome can be directly read by ribosomes
    - replication is done via a (-) RNA strand which is duplicated to many (+) strands
* (-)ssRNA = Single stranded RNA, - sense
    - genome needs to be transcribed to (+) stranded RNA before translation in the ribosomes
    - replication is done via  (+) stranded RNA
* ssDNA = Single-strand DNA
* dsDNA-RT = gapped DNA
* dsRNA = Double strand RNA
* ssRNA-RT = DNA-RNA reverse transcribing
* dsDNA = Double stranded DNA

> ###### Gene
> A *gene* denotes a piece of storage encoding a single protein. 

Often genes are sequences of single/double stranded DNA or RNA which are transcribed to positive stranded RNA which in turn can be translated to proteins. 

### Interactions between Life Forms
Nearly all forms of life are dependent on other forms of life in one way or another. Mostly they need substances for their metabolism which are only produced by other forms of life:
* All forms of life except those who are able to do photosynthesis or use other inorganic energy sources (thermal, chemical) are dependent on organic energy sources i.e. forms of energy produced by other forms of life. 
* Besides energy, mammals - including us humans - also need extern sources for vitamins, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, ...

Cell forming forms usually just need the ingredients (raw materials) and are able to produce the enzymes (machines). Where as [viruses](#virus) by definition don't produce all needed enzymes (machines).

Many forms of life live in symbiotic relations with many other forms of life: each form providing what it is best at providing at. Many interactions between life forms turned out to be beneficial and some of these even evolved into permanent couplings. Sometimes the couplings are so strong that the combination is a new form of life: E.g. mitochondria as cell organelles. 



### Keeping the Metabolism Immune
Most life forms have have some mechanisms to keep their metabolism immune i.e. reducing interactions and thus making it more self contained and controllable. These mechanisms are called [immune system](./3_immunological/immune_system.md). A simple and effective way of doing so, is shielding the metabolism by (semipermeable) membranes. The membranes evolved vary in permeability, thickness and rigidity.

#### Cell Forming Life Forms
**[in work]**
As noted all forms of life which encode their entire metabolism are dsDNA based. Many [to check if all] of these forms have their metabolism inside semipermeable membranes [to check: all double layer lipid?]. Such a structure is called a cell. Some cells have just the outer membrane:

> ##### Prokaryotes
> Some forms of life have just this outer membrane but no inner membrane shielding the genome away from the main metabolism. These forms are called *prokaryotes* (from Greek: pro=before, karyo=kernel).

Some cells are subdivided again by membranes into different compartments which are called cell organelles. If the genome is shielded by a kernel genome is shielded by a membrane this organelle is called nucleus. 

> ##### Eukaryotes
> Cell forming life forms shielding their genome by an inner membrane are called *eukaryotes* (naming done in the 60's eukaryote = with-a-well-formed-kernel; eu=well and karyo=kernel). This inner structure is called nucleus.


* Prokaryotes
  - Eubacteria
    * Cyanobacteria 
    * Bacteria
  - Archaea
* Eukaryotes
  * Plants, Animals and Fungi all belong to the eukaryotes. These eukaryotes form multicellular organisms. 
  * There are many more eukaryotes, many of them not forming multicellular organisms and thus living as single cells. Even though very divers, these are called *protozoa*. 

Often life forms specialize, organize and work together to form a more capable entity and thus the overall fitness is increased. TExamples of cooperations are symbiosis and organisms. 

<!-- Symbiosis life forms keep independence for replication or can life Inside an organism the units communicate and share resources. Sometime the units keep some independence and can go separate paths again. However many forms of life on todays earth e.g. plants, fungi and animals, are organisms:
-->

> ###### Organism
> Start out as a single cell with replicates. At some point the replicates differentiate into specialized cells having different appearances and tasks. 

For many questions, organisms are considered as a whole and not the single cells. E.g. we usually are more interested in how fast an organism moves forward/runs and not how fast some single muscle cell contracts.



## Introduction to Viruses

> ###### Virus
> A *virus* is a form of life, that encodes and has proteins produced but can't produce all necessary enzymes for its replication on its own.

* That it encodes and produces proteins distinguishes viruses from [viroids](#viroid).
* That a virus cannot produces all the required enzymes distinguishes them from more self contained forms of life.

Viruses integrate enzymes produced by other forms of life into their metabolism. Since all life forms which are enzymatically independent life forms on today's earth are [cell based](#cell-forming-life) [to check] and the metabolisms is inside the cells, viruses need to be within cells to replicate.

> ###### Infected Cell
> A cell is called *infected* by a virus if it contains genetic material of the virus which influences the cell's metabolism.

These can mean that the virus is replicating inside the cell. A cell is also called infected if only some viral genes are translated and the resulting enzymes are active and thus influence the cells metabolism. To specify, cells in which replication takes place are called host cells.

> ###### Host Cell
> A *host cell* is a cell in which a virus replicates. 

So a host cell is always an infected cell. 

Most cells don't live forever. In multicellular organisms most cells live fare shorter than the organism itself and even most cell lines don't survive and only few cells have the chance of being part of the cells giving raise to descendants [Organisms](#). If virus infected, cells often die even faster. Thus viruses need to jump to next cells. To achieve this, most viruses, including coronaviruses, have a 2 phase life cycle.

### Life Cycle
Coronaviruses have a two phase life cycle:
1. Virion phase: They are born/produced as [virion](#virion). Virions are similar to seeds of plants in the sense they have no metabolism: [passive travel](#virion-travel), wait to be [activated](#virion-attachment-and-activation) by matched with an [infectable cell](#infectable-cell) in the right environment. Once activated virions try to enter the cell.
2. Metabolic phase: Once inside a cell, a virus uses the cells metabolism to produce proteins and other substances using the structures, ribosomes, enzymes and resources (fatty acids, amino acids and ribonucleic acids) from the host cell. As for all forms of life the ultimate goal is to produce progeny = new virions.

> ###### Virion
> A *virion* is the 'birth-form' of a virus. The genome and proteins required to infect a cell are usually packed into some form of protective shell. A virion has no active metabolism.

Viruses while outside of cells are present always as virions. Virions are passively moved around. Most virions decay but some get matched to an infectable cell. Once activated, virions can [infect cells](#infected-cell) and transform to the [metabolic phase](#metabolic-phase).

> Virions are [similar to seeds of plants](#plant-seeds-to-virions): They are dormant and wait for activation. Virions don't have a metabolism running. They evolved to induce infection on the right circumstances. Once activated/primed cell fusion is initiated by using spring loaded energy stored in the structure of special proteins.


Once a virus infects cells, it changes metabolism of the cell.





> ###### Virus Infection
> An object is called *infected* by a virus if it contains cells that are infected. An object can be a tissue, an organ, a structure or an [organism](#organism).

So an organism is infected if it has some [cells that are infected](#infected-cell).

> ###### Infectable Cell
> A *infectable cell* is a cell which can be infected. There are [constraints on a cell](#cell-tropism) to be infectable.

> ###### Infectable Object
> An object is *infectable* if it can become [infected](#infected-object). An object can be a tissue, an organ, a structure (e.g. upper respiratory tract) or an organism.

There are [constraints on a object to be infectable](#tropism-of-viruses). A necessary condition for an object to become infected is the availability of [infectable cells](#infectable-cell). However this condition is not sufficient, reachability, priming factors and immune evasion are other conditions needed.

Therefore viruses are dependent on the host cells. Long-term surviving virus strains generally have a symbiotic relationship with their natural host life form as a whole but still can be fatal for individuals. The survival of fit ecosystems is ubiquitous in nature.


### Virus Classification
As defined a [life form](#life-form) encoding proteins but not all of them is called aj [virus](#virus). This definition is very broad so often further classifications/grouping are done. 

> The goal of classification is usually to group things together which are similar to some features of interest. 

Features of interest for viruses are:
* Viruses can be classified by the hosts they infect. E.g. bacteriophages infect bacteria.
* Genetic and metabolic similarity. Viruses exists across all the [different storage forms](#storage-and-duplication-options) used by life forms.
* Structural Similarity. E.g. viruses can be classified into enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.


### Virus Entities
[in work and experimental]

Similarly for viruses infecting organisms, often to grasp the full picture it is necessary to consider all viruses as an entity and not as unrelated. Viruses can show different behaviors in different cells and upon different situations:
* DNA viruses can in theory encode the same differentiation mechanisms as eukaryotic cells 
* RNA viruses don't encode the same mechanisms as DNA based forms of life e.g. for gene expression. However they still are able to show [different behaviors](#tropism-of-viruses) in different situations. 

> ###### Virus Entity
> A *Virus Entity or Virus Organism* denotes all viruses in an organism resulting from a single infection occurrence. Upon a new infection the infections can interact and give rise to a *new entity*.

Similar to the different cells in multicellular organism only few viruses in a virus entity are likely to infect new hosts and thereby form a new entity.

> Virus entities/organisms are a concept I haven't seen about in literature. Similar concepts may exists possibly under different names.

<!--
#### life cycle of a coronavirus entity
[in rework in ideas to explore section]
In outside living vertebrate hosts, the typical life cycle of a coronavirus entity is [citations and argumentation in work]:
* enter the respiratory system
* spread to the lower respiratory tract and replicate to high titers (often in ciliated epithelial cells) 
* diminish parts of the host immune system
* reach the intestine (or sometimes the kidney) by spreading through blood or through the alimentary tract via stomach
* establish a possibly longer lasting infection in the intestine(/kidney) and contineously have progeny released
* progeny: the virions get transported by wind or water to new susceptible hosts
-->


### Movement of Virions
Once virions are released from a cell the virions are moved by whatever movements are in their surroundings.   

#### Swim with the Tide
All forms of life on earth are water based. Both protein and RNA/DNA synthesis occur in water. So virions are pro therefore start out their journey in watery fluids, often the cytoplasm of a cell. Upon release they are exposed to whatever substances there are around. For most viruses their virions will always be dissolved in watery fluids and will not survive being dissolved in other fluids such as alcohol or air. 
* __Fluid dissolved in__:
    - Salty water in oceans: Water in the oceans is also likely where life and RNA viruses as an early form of life developed and still contains a huge number of virions. 
    - Water in lakes and rivers: These waters serve as an intermediate place for many virions. 
    - Fluid in an organism: Virions of viruses infecting multicellular life first start out in the fluids of the hosts and in many cases never leave the host fluids. 
    - Water droplets can be dissolved in air. 
    - Air. Air contains reactive oxygen and most virions will be destroyed, since they expose activator proteins on the outside. Coronavirus virions are a rare exception staying infectious in dry form. 
* __Material attached to__: These can be any solid material e.g. a part of living organism or any kind of non living matter. The movement of virions follows the movement of the materials attached to. These particles are in turn dissolved in fluids, mostly water, or attached to other particles. 


#### Movement within a Host
Often virions get moved within a host. Some even evolved not to leave the host organism at all. Within a host the movement of virions depends on the location they are released and the kind of material they are attached to: 
- movements with fluid flows:
    * the blood flow if the virion is in the bloodstream
    * the mucus flow 
    * respiratory tract lining fluid
    * the air breathed in and out and the [particle dynamics in the respiratory tract](#particles) associated.
- solid movements within the host i.e. the virion is attached to a moveable part:
    * inside cells with the centrosome. Especially important for viruses which need to enter the cell nucleus e.g. influenza viruses.
    * attached to particles get moved around within a host. 
    * the movement of body parts e.g. an extremity (hands and feet) or the lungs.  
- Brownian Motion: The Brownian motion of viruses is slow and by Brownian motion alone a virion usually just moves a few micro meters to reach close by cells. However if given enough time virions can diffuse to many locations both within tissues or within cells. 


<!--td move in out-->


#### Movement between hosts
[in work]
Many forms of life cannot move well on their own: Plants, bacteria and fungi. In the oceans this is less a problem thanks to the currents. On land however, all forms of life with no ability to move have the challenge to spread and genetically interact. The main options are the same for them all: Being carried by wind, water or moving organisms. Virions have to rely on this options to spread through a host populations:

* __Moveable Organism__: This is often the host where the virus was built but it can be an animal primarily transporting the virion called a transporter. 

    > ###### Transporter
    > A *transporter* for a virus is an organism which is important for its transport function in the life cycle of a virus.

    When the transporter moves the virions move with it. The farther, faster and the more possible hosts at new location the better for the virus to distribute. Optimal transportation are migrating and/or fare flying animals: flying insects, birds and bats. The usage of horses and the inventions of trains, cars and airplanes made us humans new optimal hosts. Jetting around the world from city to city is optimal for viruses since: fast travel to a new set of hosts. 

<!--
- Movement induced by the organism:-->

* __Wind__: Many plants rely on wind for spread. Some viruses too, but not many since wind driven movement has challenges:
    - The movements induced by wind are random in the sense that evolutionary adaption to directional movement is hardly possible.
      => Organisms relying on wind usually compensate this randomness often with huge numbers. As can be seen each season by the pollen powdering the landscape.  
    - The air contains reactive oxygen and sunlight exposure is frequent. Therefore genetic material needs to be well protected.
    - Particles need to have large surface in comparison to their mass, else gravity will ground them (explained in [Objects Moving in the Air](#objects-moving-in-the-air)). Except for very small particles only dry particles have a surface large enough to fly. 

    Different life forms solved these challenges: 
    * Many plants rely on wind both for genetic recombination and spread. 
    * Viruses rarely spread with the winds, since 
      * virions usually don't stay intact when dried. 
      * virions rely on host and so usually they cannot produce large enough numbers
      * viruses since they don't encode their entire metabolism have fewer options to optimize for stability and survive the harsh life condition in the air. 
  
      Exception: smallpox. Coronaviruses may do so in theory.    

* __Water__: 
    Water movement is directional to the oceans and particles need to be "fished out" not to end up there. One of the few escape options are drinking animals. 
    * Land-plants rarely use water since ending up in the oceans is not the goal of land plants.
    * Viruses infecting animals rely on water. Animals drinking brings them directly to possible hosts. 


#### Travel Probabilities
Getting matched to an infectable cell involves the following steps (steps in [...] are facultative):
- [reach a host]  
- [reach a tissue]
- reach an infectable cell

Each step has usually a low success rate. So the combined probability of reaching a target tends to be very small. 

The probability to reach a *next* exploitable host, is especially low, due to many traps and hostile environment:
* get attached to a wrong thing. High probability due to the random movement and usually the surface of non targets is fare greater than the target surface. Except confined indoor settings, in this case the surface of the combined lungs is the greatest surface - greater than the surface of all the walls.  
* sunlight destroys virions. 
* heat
* chemical environment
<!--transmission bottleneck important for evolution-->


## Introduction to Coronaviruses

### Nidovirales
Coronaviruses belong to the order of Nidovirales. Nidovirales are positive single-stranded, non-segmented and enveloped RNA viruses. This means that their genetic material is encoded as a single positive strand of RNA - the same way as messenger RNA pieces of the cell. Enveloped means they have a membrane. Nido is latin for nest and describes two distinguishing features:  
* Nidovirales share a gene expression pattern in which several genes are encoded on the same RNA piece in a nested way[todo add ref lai 92]. 
* Moreover they partly shield their metabolism with nest like structures (double vesicles membrane vesicles [=Lim et al 2016](#lim,liu-2016)) inside the host cell where the new virions are assembled. 

### Coronaviruses
The membrane is spherical and consists of structural proteins which are coated in a lipid bilayer membrane acquired from the host cell. This membrane is called envelope. 


#### Coronavirus Proteins  
[**in work and incomplete**]
- structural proteins: used to give newly built viruses structure. These are the membrane proteins (E, S, M, [HE]) and the internal protein N stabilizes the RNA
- diminish host defence
- RNA dependent RNA polymerase 
- cleavage other proteins and RNA [to check]

##### Spike Protein
The spike proteins point spike-like out of the spherical virions. This gives coronaviruses virions a corona (latin for crown or solar corona) like appearance under the electron microscope and therefore their name. Functions:
* RBD: The RBDs are located in the S1 part of the spike protein and binds to the ACE2 receptor. 
* [in work]


#### Coronaviruses Species
[in work]

##### SARS-CoV-1
Betacoronavirus identified causing Sars in 2003/2004.
* mainly lower respiratory tract infections
* ACE2 receptor

##### SARS-CoV-2
Betacoronavirus identified causing the current Covid-19 pandemics. A focus of this page and many sections contain special notes about features of Sars-CoV-2.

##### MERS-CoV
Betacoronavirus identified causing MERS. 
* infects cells in the deep lungs (bronchi and alveolis) 
* the natural hosts are dromedary camels
* main spreading events observed in indoor settings

##### Bovine Coronaviruses
Abbreviated BCoV. Betacoronavirus causing diarrhea and respiratory infections in cattle. 


## Coronavirus Life Cycle 
As mentioned in [Introduction to Viruses](#introduction-to-viruses) the viruses have a multiphase life cycle. Coronaviruses have a two phase life cycle:
* [Virion Phase](#virion-phase)
* [Metabolic Phase](#metabolic-phase)

### Virion Phase
Travel and Wait for Activation.
Virions have behave similar as seeds of plants: Travel and wait for the right conditions to unleash their energy (spring loaded proteins for viruses and starch for seeds) to start the active phase. 

#### Virion Travel 
Once released from a cell virions are moved (see [movement-of-virions](#movement-of-virions)) until they are [activated](#tropism-virion-phase) to start the cell infection process.
A virion needs to reach possibly a host, the  location of the target cells (e.g. an organ), a specific cell and then it needs to be matched to a receptor on the cell membrane in the order of nanometers. All this without being able to move on its own and thus relying on [external movements](#movement-of-virions). The virion-target match can happen because the virion is moved to the target, the target is moved to the virion or a combination. 

The infectable cell can be:
* in the same host| another host 
* in the same tissue| another tissue
* of the same cell type| another cell type

#### Virion Activation

##### Plant Seeds to Virions
> Plant seeds evolved first to travel and then to be activated under favorable conditions for growth, at least as far as the seeds are able to check the conditions. Similarly virions need to be activated to initiate cell entry and thereby start the [metabolic phase](#metabolic-phase). Plants mainly need and check the right physical and chemical conditions to growth. Correspondingly seeds are activated by their physical environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light and minerals dissolved in the surrounding water to start their metabolism. Viruses need the right biological conditions inside the cells. Coronaviruses evolved to check biological conditions: receptors on cell membranes and proteases available in the environment around the cell.


Coronaviruses virions usually need to be activated before they bind to cell or initiate cell fusion. Since:
* The spike are like springs and have stored energy by which a coronavirus virion can induce cell fusion but without metabolism virions can't reload the spikes. 
* For successful infection it is important that the virions infect useful cells. 
* The targeting cell is ideally a little away from the originating cell to make targeting for the immune system more difficult.

The spikes proteins are the only part by which coronavirus virions interact with the environment, so the spike need to be activated i.e. each activation step sets a spike to a different state. 

> ##### Spike Priming
> *Spike priming* means the spike is set to a state ready for the next step in the [cell entry process](#cell-entry). 

#### Cell Entry
- the virus gets attached to the matching receptor on the target cell mostly via the spike protein
- fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes once [primed](#priming): 
    * binding to a receptor on the cell membrane -> cleavage sites are exposed 
    * cleavage through proteases at specific cleavage sites enable a conformation change 
    * the conformation change presses the fusion-peptides of the spike protein into the cell membrane 
    * with the fusion peptides anchored in the cell membrane a further conformation change of the spike protein presses the viral and cell membrane together which can result in membrane fusion. 
- release and unpacking of genome and the structural proteins into the cytoplasm 
- once the viral RNA and the viral proteins are in the cytoplasm of a cell the [metabolism](#metabolic-phase) can start


### Metabolic Phase
The viral metabolism starts once the genetic material of a virion is processed by a cell and thus the virus changes the cells metabolism. This happens in a foreign cell and cells have mechanism in place to prevent its metabolism being changed i.e. keeping the metabolism immune. For that reason, each of the following steps has a noteworthy probability of failing. 

#### Metabolism Phase 1: Preparation
[in work]
The goal of the first phase in the metabolism is to produce RdRP (RNA dependent RNA Polymerase protein). Additionally let the ribosomes produce some proteins that diminish the cells immune mechanisms such that the cell doesn't ring the bells. Steps:
1. Release RNA -- let the host ribosomes translate two ORFs of the viral genome with frame-shifting---> two large proteins
2. --cleave--> pieces of proteins
3. --like magnets these pieces self arrange to structures--> 
   * proteins providing the right setting for the phase 2 metabolism e.g. prevent the cells protection mechanisms working
   * polymerase protein (protein capable of transcription of RNA to RNA) 

#### Metabolism Phase 2: Replication
The metabolism can produce new virions that are released from the cell. The properties and and the environment of the cell influence the properties of the virions produced. This phase is initiated by the transcription of the (+) strand RNA to a (-) strand RNA template mediated by the polymerase protein:
1. (+) RNA --transcription--> (-) RNA template
2. (-) RNA template -- transcription-->
   *  pieces of subgenomic mRNAs which get translated to mostly structural proteins (N, S, M, E, [HE])
   *  (+) RNA genomes to get packed together with the N proteins to form the nucleocapsids of new virions and thus building up new virions.


## Tropism of Viruses

###### Tropism
> *Tropism*: The word comes from Greek 'tropos' which means turning. For the movement of an organism, tropism describes the change of direction upon a stimulus. This is generalized to describe how forms of life behave under different stimuli or circumstances. Tropism of viruses describes how viruses behave in different biochemical or biological circumstances (e.g. on what conditions they enter a cell). 

> In literature, the term tropism of viruses often used only in the context of tissues: in which tissues infections are observed, denoted here as [Tissue Tropism](#tissue-tropism).

> The focus is on the tropism of coronaviruses. Many statements are true for most viruses. The more closely related the more: Coronaviruses < Nidovirales < positive sense RNA viruses < RNA viruses < viruses. 

Both evolution and biological constraints yield the tropism of viruses. Evolution favours successful survival both short-term and long-term.

Questions relevant for the tropism of viruses in the virion state:
* To which receptors under which conditions the virions attach? 
* Factors inducing activation and cell entry of virions?

Questions relevant for the tropism of viruses in the metabolic state:
* Do the cells support viral replication?
* Is cell death induced upon infections?
* Are the viruses neutralized once inside the cell?

<!--
in work ...
 Determinants for the tropism are:
* cell types:   
    - receptors expressed
    - biochemistry inside the cells
* environmental factors throughout the lifetime of a virion and around the cells mainly determine entry:
    - physical environment: e.g. temperature
    - chemical environment: e.g. pH value
    - biological environment: e.g. Virions are primed for cell entry by specific proteins
    -->
<!--
<p id='tropism-of-coronaviruses'>-----</p>

## Tropism of Coronaviruses
The general concepts are outlined in the section [tropism of viruses](#tropism-of-viruses) in this section is about the [tropism](#tropism) of coronaviruses with a focus on Sars-CoV-2. As discussed there's a tropism in the virion phase and in the metabolic phase. These two yield the overall cell tropism. -->


### Tropism Virion Phase

As described in the section [virion activation](#virion-activation) the virions need to be activated. The activation factors determine the tropism of virions:

* Environment around the Cell
    - E.g. the spike proteins of coronaviruses needs to be primed which usually means cleaved by proteases for cell entry. This cleaving can require proteases and the right physiological conditions [citations in work]<!--[Holmes](#holmes)-->.
* Matching Receptor on the target cell surface


### Metabolic Phase Tropism
[in work: incomplete and citations/confirmation in work]

> The tropism in the virion phase is better known than the tropism in the metabolic phase. One reason is the cell entry can be investigated with reprogrammed viruses (often retroviruses) expressing the coronavirus spikes and transfected cells (mostly standard laboratory cell-lines where some genes are changed so they express the desired receptors). The transfected cell however don't need to behave similar to the cells which are naturally infected. So to investigate the metabolic phase,  To investigate the metabolic phase, ideally one could look into the cells. 

#### Cell Preferences
* The cell environment shouldn't deactivate the virus or alarming the immune system.
* The cell should be able to produce many virions and thus should have a capable metabolism.

#### Metabolic Phase Tropism of Coronaviruses
[in work]
* Ciliated epithelia and secretory cells support well replication of coronaviruses both cells located in the airway and the intestine
* Immune system cells are infected but usually cell death is induced in the early phase of the viral metabolism and before replication takes place. 


### Cell Tropism
> *Cell tropism* describes how a virus behaves upon match of a virion to a specific cell type. 

The cell tropism is the combination of the [virion tropism](#tropism-virion-phase) which determines cell entry and the [tropism in the metabolic phase](#tropism-metabolic-phase) which determines the changes in the cells metabolism induced upon viral entry. 

Viruses optimized to their environment often infect only cells involved in the survival of the virus strain:
* Cells used as entry point. For coronaviruses these are often cells on the epithelial layer of respiratory tract. 
* Cells that support efficient virus replications takes place and virions easily reach the next cells to build up a population. For betacoronaviruses these are similar the entry cells i.e. secretory and ciliated cells in the epithelium of the respiratory tract.
* Cells relevant to leave a host. These vary for the different coronavirus species and the hosts infected.
    - Those coronaviruses having a [dual host life cycle](./ideas_to_explore/hypotheses_nidovirales.md): Often cells in the intestine or the kidney. 
    - For indoor living hosts these are often in the upper respiratory tract. 
* Cells which are relevant for the host immune response. Coronaviruses infect immune system cells (dendritic and T cells) and induce aptosis. 



### Tissue Tropism
The tissue tropism depends on:
* Susceptible Cells in the tissue 
* Reachability of the Cells
  * Coronaviruses usually infect the apical cell layer of the respiratory tract epithelium initially. Most [virions are released](#cell-orientation) again on the apical side to spread via the covering fluids. Some virions are released on the basal layer and can yield further infections deeper in the tissue or spread via the blood stream, especially if released from  to the kidney and the intestine from where they can leave and infect the next host. 
  * Coronaviruses are to big to diffuse efficiently inside most tissues.
* Local Immune system


## Tissue Tropism of Sars-CoV-2
[in rework to remove errata and to clarify]
The task determine to habitat of Sars-CoV-2 can be tackled either 
* a [theoretical deduction](#theoretical-deduction) based on the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. The cell tropism in turn is based on in vivo and in vitro experiments and observations.
* an [empirical deduction](#empirical-deduction) based on observations of Covid-19 cases.

### Theoretical Deduction
In the following the [tissue tropism](#tissue-tropism) of Sars-CoV-2 is deduced from the [cell tropism](#cell-tropism-of-sars-cov-2) and the reachability of the tissue in question. 

#### SARS-2 Cell Entry
[in rework/reorder]
The cell entry receptor used by SARS-CoV-1 [[Jiang](#jiang)] and SARS-Cov-2 [[LiF](#lif)],[[Hoffmann](#hoffmann)] is ACE2.

#### Cell Tropism of Sars-Cov-2
[in work]
* efficient replication
    - alveolar type 2 cells
    - alveolar macrophages
* infection but no replication
    - dendritic cells [check: if ACE2 expressed/other mechanism of phagocytosis]: aptosis induce
* no entry
    - Cells not expressing ACE2. 
    - Except if the cells phagocyte virions on their own and the virions are able to fuse the membranes once phagocyted (usually captured in an endosome). 
    E.g. antibody marked virions can get phagocyted by macrophages. 
    
        > This is both relevant upon reinfection and for the design of vaccines. Antibodies against the outer membrane proteins (e.g. the spike) can be a two-sided sword.

#### Cell Orientation  
*  The transmission pathways of human coronaviruses (mostly airborne and vector-less) yield an initial deposition of the virions on the apical side together with the barrier function of the epithelial cell layer, the virions come mostly in contact with the apical sides of cells.
* In vitro [cell culture to check] experiments from [McCray & Co](#mccray05) show both increased apical ACE2 expression and a corresponding increased cell entry from the apical side. [McCray & Co](#mccray05) also observed in the lab that Sars-CoV-1 exits the cell on the apical side following an apical entry with a preference of more than 1000:1. Similarly was observed for the common cold causing coronavirus 229E: It infects the cells, corresponding to its receptor, amino-peptidase N, expression, preferably from the apical surface [[McCray](#mccray)]. 229E exits apically with a preference of 10:1 (about 91%) for an apical entry and 5:1 (about 83%) for a basal entry.    

#### ACE2 Receptor Detection
There are two common methods to measure tissue distribution of proteins:
* ##### Antibody Staining
    Proteins on cell surfaces can be visualized by using marked antibodies. Several groups have analyzed tissues with ACE2 antibodies: [Timens](#timens), [McCray](#mccray05), [soilleux, poehlmann](#soilleux,poehlmann)
* ##### Measure mRNA
    Measure ACE2 [mRNA](#mrna) expression. Necessary condition for a cell to produce a protein. However not sufficient for ACE2 on apical cell surface [to confirm]. The mRNA expression across the human body is shown in  [Li et al](#li).

##### Caveats of ACE2 Detection
[in work, verification needed]
For serving as an entry point, ACE2 needs to be built into the cell membrane as a receptor i.e. being useable from the outside. If _both_ of above methods are positive, this is very likely [antibody staining is likely enough, to check]. Since coronaviruses have a preference for [apical tissue sites](#tissue-tropism) ACE2 should be expressed on the apical sites. 
* [Antibody staining](antibody-staining) alone can yield false positives if the cells are not properly cleaned and ACE2 is just attached to the cell without being built into the cell membrane. 
* [Measuring mRNA](#measure-mrna) just detects if the cells produces ace2. But proteins produced by a cell can  
    - stay in the cell e.g. in the cytoplasm or move into the nucleus
    - be released from the cell
    - being built into the cell membrane on the basal side or on the apical side as a receptor <= needed by coronaviruses. 

#### ACE2 Receptor Distribution
[**incomplete and in rework**]
[recommended read is [soilleux, poehlmann 2012](#soilleux,poehlmann) where ACE2 receptor distribution obtained from tissue staining is described]
ACE2 is apically available 
* in the lower respiratory tract
    - well-differentiated and ciliated airway epithelia [[mcray05](#mccray05)] 
    - alveolar epithelial type 2 cells [to check/find citation].
  
* in the upper respiratory tract
    - the basal layer of the non-keratinised squamous epithelium of the nasal and oral mucosa and the nasopharynx expresses ACE2 [Timens](#timens), [Lau](#lau). 
    - goblet cells[todo: other cells (goblet) too in rework]


### Empirical Deduction of the SARS-2 Tissue Tropism
[in rework: update and a section for each strain]
Viral load in combination with the [movements of virions](#movement-of-virions) inside the body can be used to track tissue preferences of Sars-CoV-2. 

#### Betacoronavirus Viral Load
[in rework]
The viral loads observed in different parts of the body are consistent with airborne infection and the tissue distribution of ACE2:
* The only location where _all_ patients had viral Sars-CoV-1 load are the lungs [Farcas et al](#farcas). 
* For MERS-Cov [Memish et al.](#memish) found that both the viral load and the Genome Fraction obtained was higher in the lower respiratory tract (broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, tracheal fluid) than in the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swab, sputum). The three broncho-alveolar lavage fluid samples investigated, showed the highest average viral load and contained the most complete genome.
Remark: Mers-Cov has a different cell entry receptor (DPP4). However 
* the ability of a virus to efficiently takeover a cell depends not on the cell entry receptor alone. 
* some and especially the severe SARS-2 infections show a similar pathogenesis as MERS

This is just a piece of evidence in the overall picture. 

That in swab tests there are viruses in the nose and the mouth can be either caused by replication there or by breathing them up. [Kleinstreuer et al](#kleinstreuer) have shown that upon exhale particles are deposited in the nose. The upper respiratory tract is used to fight viruses and so infections are rarely virulent [Disease Pattering](./2_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md).



## Habitat
[in rework]
As outlined in the section [tropism](#tropism) there is a variety of conditions for a virus to start to metabolism and even more too successfully replicate. These environments form the habitat of a virus strain:

> ###### Habitat
> The *Habitat* of a virus are the locations which are frequently infected: [cells](#infected-cell), tissues, organs or [organism](#infectable-organism). E.g. Sars-CoV-2 frequently infects alveolar type 2 epithelial cells. These are called a habitat as well as the surrounding organ: the human lungs and the host organism: us humans. 

### Organisms Habitat aka Hosts
The organisms forming the habitat are called hosts:

> ###### Host
> A *host* of a virus is an [infectable organism](#infectable-organism) and these infections occur frequently and are relevant for the spread of the virus i.e. are part of the life cycle.

> ###### Endemic
> A virus strain is *endemic* in a collection of organisms if that collection is a habitat of the virus.

Sometimes it is helpful to name frequently infected organism which play no role in the virus spread:

> ###### Side Host
> A *Side Host* or *Terminal Host* of a virus is a [host](#host) but the infections yield *no* relevant spread of the virus. E.g. the virus cannot efficiently replicate or leave the host. These infections can be viewed as side-effects of the random virus spread. Viruses can evolve such that a Side Host becomes a Host.

### Conquering new Habitats
The virus can get attached to a cell types or hosts the given strain which are not part of its current habitat. Most likely the entity of viruses doesn't manage to adapt to the new target. However if a lineage of viruses manages to adapt to the new target, this becomes a new habitat. 
The new habitat can be:
- a new cell type
- a new tissue type
- a new organism type: [infecting new species](#infecting-new-species)

Since in new habitats there often is a different evolutionary drive, the line of viruses can give rise to a new virus strain.  

### Infecting New Species
With no metabolism running virions can not move on their own and so they can't steer their [movement](#movement-of-virions) to only reach their hosts. If a virus strain reaches organism of some species, there are several cases <!--[in programming languages: switch(animal)/animal match]-->:
* the organism reached is a host -> continue life cycle 
* the organism reached is not a host:
    - it is not infectable -> break
    - it is infectable. This yields an [*interspecies infection*](#interspecies-infection). Again two cases:
        * the virus entity can *not* efficiently leave to keep up the chain of infections: on average less than one virion (i.e. reproduction factor is < 1)-> break i.e. the infection chain is a cul-de-sac and the organisms are [side hosts or terminal hosts](#side-host) 
        * on average more than one virion of a virus entity can leave and infect another organism (i.e. the reproduction factor is > 1) -> gives rise to a new life cycle: an [*interspecies jump*](#interspecies-jump) has happened. Since the evolutionary drive changes, this can give raise to a new virus strain. 
    
> ###### Interspecies Infection
> An _interspecies infection_ is when an animal which is not an existing [host](#host) animal becomes infected by a virus strain. 

> ###### Interspecies Jump
> An *interspecies jump* denotes a transmission to a new species and the species becomes a new [host](#host) i.e. the new species becomes part of the habitat of the virus. The virus strain may evolve to an adapted new strain.

> ###### Zoonosis
> A *zoonosis* is an [interspecies jump](#interspecies-jump) where the new host species is human (homo sapiens).

So an interspecies infection denotes a transmission without spread in the new species. If these infections occur frequently the new species becomes a side host but not a natural host. Frequent infections allow the virus strain to adapt to the new host. The host may become part of a life cycle of a possibly new virus strain which is then an [interspecies jump]


#### Observed Interspecies Infections
* all occurrences where [interspecies jumps](#interspecies-jumps) occurred at least one [interspecies infection](#interspecies-infection) must have occurred. But it is likely that many interspecies infections occurred before the jump happened. 
* Infections of Humans:
    - In the 70s and 80s there were a couple of reports that BCoV regularly causes infections in the human intestines. Most of them are based on EM images and serological evidence. However, since most groups couldn't cultivate the viruses and there's some doubt [citations on the way]. 
    - The HECV-4408 coronavirus was isolated from a child having diarrhea [Zhang et al](#zhang94)
    - Using RNA sequence data and evolution-models [Dudas et al](#dudas2017) conclude that there are likely hundred of infections per year from camel to humans. 
#### Observed Interspecies Jumps
* jumps: Bovine coronaviruses have jumped to a whole range of hosts: canine, human, wild ruminants, porcine [Bidokhti et al](#bidokhti).
* jumps to humans, also called [zoonosis](#zoonosis): MERS, Sars-CoV-1 and OC43 are all jumped from animals to humans [refs in work]. 



## Evolution and Adaption
[in work]

Coronaviruses can adapt fast to changed or new environments if given time and opportunity. The adaption over multiple generations occurs through genetic evolution i.e. mutation of RNA genome. 
The genetic evolution of coronaviruses is fast compared to other [forms of life](#life-form) because:
* a short average generation-time (only a few hours [to be confirmed]) 
* properties of [single stranded RNA replication](#ssRNA). The mechanism of RNA copying is: 
    - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which yields a high rate of random point mutations compared to DNA polymerases
    - a homologous recombination mechanism [[Woo et al.](#woo)] , more refs coming]
* Genome is [encoded in RNA and not in DNA](#lifetime-storage) 
* large population size both within hosts and the number of infected hosts (for Sars-CoV-2)

Coronaviruses have large genomes (in comparison to other RNA viruses or messenger RNAs) which both back the recombination and encode complex proteins. The coronavirus RNA genome is among the largest strands of RNA occurring on todays earth, possibly even the largest [to check].  
[in work]

### Conserved Patterns
[in work]
Some parts of the coronavirus genome 
* Functional units of proteins. The more fundamental there function is, the more conserved they tend to be.
* Internal proteins of viruses are more difficult to target for the immune system, therefore the corresponding genes have less evolutionary drive to adapt.
* For coronaviruses, the replication mechanism is well conserved and thus the proteins involved.

Examples of well conserved proteins for coronaviruses are:
* RNA viruses need to duplicate their RNA for replication, which requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein. This protein is well conserved [to check, citation coming]. 
* The coronavirus RNA is packaged with the help of a nucleocapsid protein, usually denoted by N.
