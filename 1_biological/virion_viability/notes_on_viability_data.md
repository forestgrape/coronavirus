# Notes on Temperature and Humidity Viability Data

### Notes
Supplementary data to [Virion Viability](../virion_viability.md). The study names correspond to the reference names therein.

#### Matrix
The matrix is the medium the virions are suspended. 
MM = Minimal Medium, MEM = Minimal Essential Medium, CCM = Cell Culture Medium
exact specifications often given in the [summarized references](../virion_viability.md#references)  on the virion_viability page.

#### Material and Humidity
The material the suspension with the virions was deposited before exposure. An empty field if the virions were kept in the suspension and not exposed to drying (therefore the humidity field is empty too).

## Table
> The presentation of the table is not optimal on github (both github pages and github markdown viewer): there is a slider at the very bottom to scroll. Currently downloading and viewing in the program of choice works better.
