## Summary Virion Stability and Decay
[Virions](./coronavirus.md#virion) aren't very stable compared to other forms of live. The principal reasons for the instability of virion are:
* The genome is [stored in error-prone ssRNA](./coronavirus.md#ssrna)
* The envelope of coronaviruses consists of fatty acids which form the cell membranes of the virus host organism. In multicellular organism the cell membranes neither have evolved to be stable outside the organism nor to keep out most substances.
* The spike store have spring loaded energy which is used for cell fusion. Thus the spikes are under tension. On heat, temperature changes or chemical forces the spikes can loose this energy.
* Virions have no metabolism and thus cannot repair any damage occurred.

### Decay Situations
[Virions](./coronavirus.md#virion) decay happens everywhere: in the air, in the body, on surfaces and in water. Depending on the environment at different speed and with different mechanisms. In some situations the decay is dominated by the fastest mechanisms, in other situations different decay mechanisms interact or several have similar speeds and so all of them have to be taken into account to estimate the overall decay. Due the different mechanisms at different situations estimating the decay can be complicated.

Decay mechanism in different situations are:
* Outdoors during the day the UV part of sunlight quickly breaks the RNA of virions even on cloudy days.
* Virions exhaled in samples of respiratory fluids, which biochemicals such as antivirals, proteins and salts.
  * At an air humidity between 40% and 90%: As long as the samples don't dry out, the biochemicals act on the virions and the decay is quite fast even at lower temperatures. The rate is fastest just before the samples dry since the concentration of biochemicals is highest.
  * At an air humidity above 95%: The droplet expand there size in humid environment the virions can explode due to osmotic pressure, which results in a very fast decay.
  * At an air humidity below 40%: the droplets dry out the substances crystallize and only self decay occurs, which is slow at low temperatures.
* In the stomach virions are inactivated by acids.

### Decay Factors and Mechanisms
Common decay mechanisms and their speeds as halflife times. Self decay is the decay without extern factors except temperature and PH values. The self decay is the fastest decay form at temperatures above 45 degrees. At lower temperatures decay by biochemicals is usually faster, except if the samples are dried, since without water there is no decay through biochemicals.

#### Self Decay
[**in work and to check/confirm the numbers**]
Self decay is mainly governed by self RNA decay up to about 45 degrees celsius. Above about 45 degrees the spike proteins start loosing functionality becomes the main decay mechanism.
The self decay rate is approximately piecewise linear:
* below 40 degrees: The RNA decay dominates. The rate doubles (the halftime halves) about every 7 degree temperature increase.
* 40 to 45 degrees: The rate of the RNA decay and the spike deactivation is about the same.
* Above 45 degrees: The spike decay rate doubles (the halftime halves) about every 2 degrees.
* Above 65 degrees: The lipid envelope decays

##### RNA Self Decay
* at 4 degrees: about 200 hours 
* at 22 degrees: about 20 hours 
* at 37 degrees: about  5 hours 

###### RNA and Spike Self Decay
* at 45 degrees: about  2 hours

###### Spike Self Decay
* at 55 degrees: about 2 - 5 minutes (spikes)
* at 70 degrees: about 10 seconds (lipid envelope and proteins)


#### Sunlight
At low UV (e.g low sun in the fall) the halflife time is about 6 minutes and at high UV (e.g. sun in summer) about 2 min.

#### Biochemicals
Decay by biochemicals inactivate virions mainly from the outside by interacting with the spike protein or destroying the lipid envelope. Rates at room temperature (22 degree) 
* In sputum/nasal mucus/saliva/on the skin: 
  The decay rate double about every 10 degrees temperature increase. The rate is highest at relative humidities such that the samples shrink due to evaporation but don't dry out.
  * at 4 degrees: about 5 to 10 hours
  * at 22 degrees: a few hours (1 to 4 hours)
* Common disinfectants (e.g. ethanol 70%, iodine 7.5%): a few seconds
* Soap: About 20 seconds

## Decay Rate
[**in work**]

### Measuring Infectious Virions
To measure infectious viruses cell culture experiments are necessary. The methods detecting building blocks of viruses (PCR and antigen tests) yield positive regardless whether the virions are intact and infectious (page [diagnosis and viral load](./diagnosis_and_viral_load.md)).

### Exponential Decay
When each member of a collection has some time independent chance to replicate or decay during a certain time span independent of the other members, the whole collection growths or decays exponentially. Examples:
* The decay of radioactive material is exponential since each atom has some probability to decay during a fixed time span.
* Change of prevalence of a disease in a homogenous  or at least time homogenous population (time homogenous is approximately true for SARS-2 strains at low numbers of infected throughout the population structure/groups).

### Virion Decay
In most circumstances virions decay independently of each other with a fixed probability during a given time span. Therefore the decay is exponential.

### Quantifying Decay Rate
Common measures for the rate of an exponential decay are:
* half life time = half of the collection is intact = time to get a 50 % reduction =  log2 reduction time 
* tenth life time = a tenth of the collection is intact = time to get a 90% reduction = log10 reduction time 



## Decay Factors
[**in work**]
A decay factor can directly damage virions (e.g. UV light directly destroys RNA) or a factor can just modify the the decay rate of another mechanism. Often many factors interplay to yield the overall decay rate. 

> ##### Direct Effects
> Direct effects denote the direct damage of a factor.

> ##### Modifying Effects
> Modifying effects alternate rate of other decay mechanisms.


### Temperature
[**in work and to check/confirm and cite**]
The temperature is denotes the average kinetic energy of the atoms a substance consists of. Higher temperature 1) can enable and increase the probability of reactions upon collision and 2) increases the number of collisions. 
By 1) higher temperature can enable and increase the speed of self decay mechanisms 

#### Direct Effect on Self Decay
* Proteins can undergo conformation changes and loose functionality.
* RNA decays faster at higher temperature.
* The lipid envelopes looses stability.

#### Modifying Effects on Other Decay Factors
* Temperature changes effect [evaporation and condensation](#evaporation-and-condensation). The water amount changed induces [osmotic forces](#osmotic-pressure).
* Increased speed of [biochemical reactions](#biological-and-chemical-substances)

### PH Values
At temperatures around 22 degrees PH values between 3 and 10 don't do much to destroy virions. However changes of the PH values alter the intrinsic decay of virions e.g. at temperatures between 30 degrees and 55 degrees the decay is elevated if the PH value is 8 instead of 7.

### Evaporation and Condensation
Evaporation and condensation affect the concentration of chemical and biological substances. Which can result in [osmotic pressure](#osmotic-pressure) and concentration changes of [biochemicals](#biochemicals).

### Osmotic Pressure
Droplets of any size in the air or on surfaces are subject to evaporation and condensation. The induced concentration changes of salts and proteins yield osmotic forces. 

### UV Light
[in work]
The UV part of sun light destroys RNA. Even stable DNA in the inner layer of the skin, protected by outer layer of the skin which contains light absorbing melanin (the more light absorbing melanin the less sunlight reaches the inner layer of the skin), a cell membrane and inside the cell nucleus takes damage from exposure to UV. => RNA decay

### PH Values
* PH values between 3 and 10 mainly adapt the rate of other factors. 
* Extreme PH values below 3 or above 10 actively inactivate CoVs. => Proteins, Envelope

### Biochemicals
[in work]
Extern biochemicals act on the spike or the envelope. Biochemicals entering the virion can act on intern or extern structures.

* __Digestive enzymes__ from other organisms e.g. bacteria in water (sea, oceans, rivers) or in the alimentary tract disintegrate the envelope.
* __Soap__ destroys the lipid envelope and so the virions.
* __Neutralizing antibodies__ can bind to the spike proteins and thereby the spike proteins loose the functionality to do the cell fusion.
* __Antiviral substances__ found in most body fluids destroy virions e.g. by changing the structure of the spike proteins, destroying the lipid envelope.
* __Proteins__ (even when they do not have enzymatic functions targeting virions) can interact with the spike protein and induce conformation changes whereby the spikes loose the ability to induce cell fusion.
* __Hydrogen Peroxide__: Denatures Proteins, RNA.



## Decay Mechanism
[**in work**]
Coronavirus virions are composed of three classes of building blocks: RNA, Proteins and a lipid envelope. Each class of these building blocks is subject to decay. From the outside accessible is only the envelope and the spikes protein.

On this page, factor induced decay and self decay are distinguished:

> ##### Factor Induced Decay
> Factor induced decay is induced by external factors such as UV light or chemicals.

> ##### Self Decay
> The self decay depends only on the [internal state](#internal-state) of the virion and no external factors are necessary.

> ##### Internal State
> The internal state denotes the physical and chemical characterization of a virion. he internal state is the temperature, ph value and the building blocks (RNA, proteins, envelope) and possible other substances.

The internal state characteristics can be constant or variable throughout the life span of a virion:
- Constant: all virion proteins and most other proteins present (the exact number of virus proteins and other host cell acquired proteins),  host cell acquired substances e.g. fatty acids, lipid envelope, RNA genome (can point mutate).
- Variable: PH value, temperature, biochemicals able to pass the envelope


### RNA Decay

#### RNA Self Decay
RNA is not very stable and bases can mutate which yield unusable RNA
Modifying Factor: Temperature -> at increasing temperature RNA decays faster

#### RNA Decay by UV Light
UV light can cause structural changes in the RNA
Required Factor: UV Light

### Protein Decay
Coronaviruses have the proteins N = nucleocapsid protein, M = membrane protein, E = envelope protein and S = spike protein (some e.g. bovine coronaviruses additionally HE protein). 
* The spike proteins is most susceptible to loosing function since 1) the spikes point out from the envelope and thus is well accessible and exposed to substances on the outside. 2) The spikes are not in an energy minimized conformation to have spring loaded energy to initiate cell fusion, this tension makes the delicate.
* The M, E and N protein are generally more stable than the S protein, so if any of the proteins looses function, it is most likely the S protein [to check and cite].

#### Spikes Self Decay
The spike protein of coronaviruses is temperature sensitive due to the spring loaded energy. Above 45 degree the spike can loose the functionality e.g. the transformation from pre- to post-fusion state can occur spontaneously.

#### Spike Decay by Biochemicals 
[Biochemicals](#biochemicals) can induce direct changes or accelerate other mechanisms.
* Proteins
  * Can bind and block functional groups such as cleavage sites or the RBD 
  * Induce conformational changes e.g. induce the transformation from pre- to post-fusion state.
* Neutralizing antibodies can bind to the spikes.

#### Proteins E,M and N Decay
The E,M and N proteins are more stable regarding self decay than the spikes. Regarding biochemicals, the spikes are more exposed to the outside, so the spikes loose functionality first [to confirm and cite].

### Lipid Envelope Decay
#### Factors Influencing Protein Decay
* Temperature: The lipid envelope looses stability and becomes more permeable at temperatures above 65 degrees [to check and cite].
* Osmotic Pressure: can explode the envelope [to confirm and cite]
* Biochemicals: E.g. soap

##### Methods
The survival of TGEV and MHV in cell culture medium at 9 temperature-humidity combinations - Temperatures (4 C, 20 C, 40 C)  X  Humidities (20%, 50%, 80%) - was determined.
##### Methods Details
* Viruses: "TGEV was grown in swine testicular (ST) cell cultures, and MHV was grown in delayed brain tumor (DBT) cell cultures."
* Virion Medium and Surfaces: "... viral inocula were suspended in cell culture medium (which contained proteins, other organic biomolecules, physiological salts, and other constituents and resembled human secretions) and placed on test surfaces. The test surfaces were carriers that were 1-cm2 thin stainless steel coupons with a no. 4 polish."
* Measuring: 
  * "Viral titers were determined by using quantal assays for cytopathic effects (CPE) and are expressed below as most probable numbers (MPN)."
  * "The virus survival at each time point was expressed as log10(Nt/N0), where Nt is the virus concentration (in MPN/ml) at time t and N0 is the initial virus concentration (in MPN/ml) in the control sample at time zero."
* Experiments: 
  * "For survival tests, 10 micro liter containing 104 to 105 MPN of test viruses was inoculated onto three replicate carriers per time point and placed in a controlled RH environment." 
  * "Control carriers (time zero) were kept at each AT and RH until they were dry and were sampled immediately after drying. The exception was the carrier incubated at 40°C and 80% RH. Under these conditions, virus inactivation took place within a few hours. Consequently, the carriers were sampled beginning at 2 h after inoculation, when the virus inoculum was still wet."
  * "Based on virus recovery experiments, 1.5% beef extract (pH 7.5) was used to elute viruses from carriers (data not shown). At desired time points, carriers were removed, placed in a 24-well plate, and covered with 1 ml beef extract. Viruses were eluted by agitation on a shaking platform (60 rpm) for 20 min at room temperature. Eluted samples were diluted in cell culture medium, and virus infectivity was assayed using the appropriate host cell line. Three replicate carriers were assayed per time point."

##### Methods
* Virus Strain: SARS-CoV-2 (Betacoronavirus/Australia/ SA01/2020)
* Virus Culture: "The virus was passaged four times through Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL- 1586) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with Penicillin, Streptomycin, Fungizone and 10% fetal calf serum and pelleted via ultracentrifugation at 100,000×g for 90 min."
* Material/Surface Preparation: "All surfaces were prepared by cutting into approx. 1–1.5 cm2 coupons, non-porous surfaces were disinfected prior to use by washing in a mild detergent (Beck- man 555), rinsing in distilled water and then immersing in 80% v/v ethanol. Paper bank notes (in very good condition) were heated in a dry oven to 75 °C for 1 h to reduce bacterial/viral contamination. The 100% cotton cloth was steam sterilised prior to use."
* Experiments Settings:
  * Preparation: "Stock virus was diluted in a defined organic matrix, consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA), mucin and tryptone, following international standard ASTM E2197 [15], designed to mimic the composition of body secretions. Briefly, 360 μL of virus stock was added to 160 μL of a solution consisting of 2.5 mg/mL BSA, 3.5 mg/mL tryptone and 0.8 mg/mL mucin. Ten microlitres of the result- ing suspension (final concentration of 3.38×105/10 μL) was inoculated onto the centre of the coupon and allowed to dry in a BSCII for 1 h."
  * "Once dry, the coupons were placed into a humidified climate chamber (Memmert HPP110) for specified time points. Samples were incubated in the dark to limit any effect light might have on viral decay. A single humidity set point (50% relative humidity) was maintained for each of three separate temperature experiments (20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C)."
* Virion Recovery: "For non-porous surfaces, for each replicate, virus was eluted in 2×115 μL volumes of DMEM with repeated pipetting then titrated individually, in quadruplicate wells on a 96-well plate. For recovery from cotton cloth, inoculated swatches of the cloth were individually submersed in 500 μL DMEM and pipetted repeatedly for at least 1 min before 230 μL of the recovered eluent from each swatch was titrated separately,5 in quadruplicate."
* Measuring Survival: "The virus was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and stored at − 80 °C. The virus stock was titrated on Vero E6 cells and the TCID 50 was determined to be 4.97×107/mL by the Spearman–Karber method [12, 13]."

##### Methods Details
* Virus Strain: "Purdue and the D52 strains were used as the source of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)"
* Cell and Virus Cultures: "The virus was propagated in the pig kidney cell line RP_D, and maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 2% calf serum; the cultures were frozen at -70 °C at the first signs of c.p.e."
* Sample Preparation and Medium: "Supernatant fluids from infected cultures were thawed and then clarified by low-speed centrifugation before dilution 1:10 in a 50 mM-HEPES solution (Sigma) buffered at pH 7 or 8, and supplemented with antibiotics. For short incubations this solution was preheated before adding the virus. One ml amounts in glass tubes were placed in well-stirred water baths in the dark. Duplicate aliquots were removed at given times and stored at -70 °C until titration of infectivity."
##### Results
* "An exponential decrease of infectivity, without an initial shoulder, could be observed between 31 and 51 °C. Thus, the inactivation proceeded as a first-order reaction, implying that the virus preparations were homogeneous." // Figure 1 a and b
* "At a higher temperature (55 °C) a two component curve was observed (omitted for clarity), a finding which has been occasionally recognized with some other RNA viruses (see Ginoza, 1968)."
* "Thermal inactivation of the virus at pH 8 showed that the half-life at any temperature is markedly reduced (Fig. 1 b)."
* "Thermal inactivation of a coronavirus essentially resembles that observed previously with several other RNA viruses. TGEV thermal inactivation is mediated by two thermodynamically distinct reactions below and above 45 °C."
