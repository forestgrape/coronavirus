## Public Description
Covid-19 has different clinical pictures and [symptoms](#immune-response-and-symptoms). The appearances vary since SARS-CoV-2 can infect different parts of the respiratory tract (except the vocal folds) and even other organs. The locations infected in turn determine the symptoms. Therefore any kind of respiratory symptoms - except a hoarse voice - can indicate Covid-19. With symptoms avoiding crowded indoor spaces is important. 
Many of the symptoms are not specific to Covid-19, they may have other causes than SARS-CoV-2 such as having a (respiratory) infection with different virus or a bacterium, having eaten/drunken something harmful (e.g. rotten or too much alcohol)or just not having had enough sleep. In doubt a Covid-19 test can help. A positive results means avoiding foreign indoor room. A negative result is no free pass however, a single negative test does not exclude an infection. 



## Infections and Diseases

> ##### Disease
> A *disease* is a biological disorder of structure or function in an organism causing inconvenience and/or unwanted effects. Literally disease means without-ease (dis=without, separated from). 

A disease is often dynamic and an immune response is induced/involved. Chemical/biochemical damages such as dehydration, a poisoning or physical damage such as a fracture or an injury are not diseases themselves but chemical/physical damage can result from a disease.

There are many different causes of diseases:
* other [life forms](../2_biological/life-forms.md#life-form) interfering with the metabolism, such an interference is called [infection as defined below](#virus-infection). 
  * outside of cells but inside multicellular organisms
    * most bacteria
    * fungi
  * inside cells
    * some bacteria
    * all viruses
* immune disease in which the immune system overreacts to substances without need (notes on the immune system in the [Immune System chapter](../4_immunological/immune_system.md))

Virus diseases are cause by virus infections:

> ##### Virus Infection
> A *virus infects* an organism by infecting cells of the organism. A virus infects a cell by entering it and changing/hijacking the cells metabolism to produce virus progeny - called virions. More about viruses and their infections in the chapter [Introduction to Viruses](../2_biological/viruses.md#introduction-to-viruses)

If a virus infection causes lack of ease, one has a virus disease:

> ##### Virus Disease
> A *virus disease* is a [virus infection of an organism](../2_biological/viruses.md#virus-infection) causing adverse effects. 

Adverse effects result either directly through tissue damage caused by viruses or more frequent to keep the core parts of the body virus free (to prevent future cell/tissue damage) a strong immune response is induced causing effects on its own.

The definition of a virus disease is not strict:  
* Adverse effects or tissue damage are often small and no lack of ease is caused. For most viruses very mild infections are not considered diseases. 
* For viruses which can be highly pathogenic usually one speaks of a disease if there is an infection diagnosed regardless whether there are symptoms or adverse effects.

> ##### Covid-19
> *Covid-19* stands for COronaVIrus Disease 2019. As of December 2020, all SARS-CoV-2 infections are called Covid-19. 

In colloquial language, "Covid-19" is often used synonymously with having SARS-CoV-2 viruses detected in the upper respiratory tract, often tested by nasopharyngeal sampling and PCR testing. However the situation is not that simple:  
* Not all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a detectable amount of viruses in the nose since SARS-CoV-2 can infect the lower respiratory tract only. Especially people with a sensible immune system may experience symptoms without having a detectable viral load in the upper respiratory tract. But it is also possible to have severe Covid-19 without having detectable viruses by nose swabs [citation in work].  
* On the contrary some people have a detectable viral load in the upper respiratory tract but no symptoms. 

More about in the chapter [Diagnosis](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) and [Infections Locations](#infection-locations).


The following terms describe the symptom stage of a person.

> ##### Symptomatic
> A person experiencing/notifying/showing symptoms of a disease is called symptomatic. 
> ##### Asymptomatic
> A person *not* experiencing/notifying/showing symptoms while having an infection is called asymptomatic.
> ##### Presymptomatic
> Even those person developing symptoms are asymptomatic in the early phase of a disease during these phase a person is called presymptomatic. 

## Disease Factors
A virus disease is an interplay of host factors including the host immune system, the behavior of the virus and of environmental factors.

* __Host Factors__ relevant for the tropism of Covid-19 are
    - Cells susceptible to infection and capable of producing viruses (not all cells are susceptible e.g. red blood cells are not susceptible to virus infections ).
    - Host [immune response](#immune-response-and-symptoms).
* __Capabilities and Behavior of the Virus__
  Viruses behave different under different environmental factors (called tropism of viruses), described in the section [Tropism of viruses](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#tropism). E.g. SARS-2 virions can initiate cell entry only for cells containing a matching receptor. To infect a tissue several conditions must be met as described in the chapter [Tissue Tropism of SARS-CoV-2](../2_biological/coronavirus.md/#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2).
* __Environmental Factors__
    - the travel of virions between hosts and thus the mode of the initial infection. E.g. in dry air exhaled droplets dry out and these are more likely to be deposited deep in the lungs.
    - Environmental factors can influence the host factors as well as the virus tropism and thus indirectly the course of the disease. E.g.:
      - Very dry air can weaken the immune system of the mucous membrane in the respiratory tract.
      - Dirty air can weaken defence mechanisms against viruses e.g. ciliated cells are damaged and thereby the clearance of particles in the respiratory tract is reduced.



## Infection Locations
SARS-CoV-2 infects different tissues in humans. The effects from the virus infection such as tissue damage and symptoms are often local to the infected locations.

Different topics related to the infection locations are described in the sections:
* The chapter [Diagnosis and Viral Load](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) describes in which body fluids and tissues how many virions are observed. This indicates an infected tissues close by.
* The [Immune Response and Symptoms](#immune-response-and-symptoms) section gives an overview of the different symptoms induced by the infection location.
* In the [coronavirus chapter](../2_biological/coronavirus.md), the section [tissue tropism](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2) describes how and which tissues are infected by coronaviruses and SARS-2 especially.
* The experimental chapter [Coronavirus Disease Pattering](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) describes that coronavirus infections at different locations can be experienced/observed as different diseases.



## Immune Response and Symptoms
[in work]

### Causes of Symptoms
The symptoms of a [virus disease](#virus-disease) are caused:
1. Direct symptoms through cell damage. Only in severe cases. 
2. Indirect symptoms through the induced immune response([Sketching of the Immune System](../4_immunological/immune_system.md).

### Symptoms at different Locations
> A similar section is in the chapter [Disease Pattering](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md), a merge is planned.
 
Infection symptoms depend on the infected locations. SARS-CoV-2 infects different [Locations](#infection-locations). Typical symptoms for the different locations are: 
* Upper Respiratory Tract => Symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases: a sore throat, coughing and a runny nose. Loss of smell or taste.
* Throat => Coughing, the body wants to get rid of the viruses in the respiratory tract, virions cleared to the intestine can cause diarrhea.
* Trachea => Coughing
* Central Lungs i.e. bronchi => Strange feeling in the chest like something sticky being inside (dry mucus loaded with viruses).
* Deep Lungs i.e. in the alveoli => The lungs can get inflamed. Strange feeling in the chest. Shortness of breath. Early on virions are released into the blood.
* Blood i.e. viraemia => This feels like it is starting from within. Symptoms can be chills (because the body is increasing the temperature to fight the viruses) or just strange feeling, similar to a weak poisoning when having eaten something rotten or drunken too much. Feeling tired, energy-less. 
*  Intestine => Diarrhea can both start early and later on and often outlasts the respiratory infection by days or even weeks.


## Disease Stages
[in work]


## Prevention and Treatment
[in work and incomplete]

### Movement
Movement is import for optimal functioning of the immune system. A good working immune system in turn is important regarding the prevention, the treatment and recovering of/from Covid-19. Moderate movement (e.g. a walk or home stretching. For home sports ventilation of the room before and afterwards is important) is recommended even when infected, while exercise is only recommended when fit and healthy.

> In some regions if tested positive a walk outdoors is  only allowed for people in house with a garden. Though the detection rate of mild cases is usually very low, so many will have no formal restrictions.

> Movement can be associated with deep breathing which is aerosol generating. Therefore when possibly infected and with people to protect in the same flat, it is important to be in a separate room and ventilate the room even after stretching and light exercise. Regarding aerosol transmission outdoors is still way safer.

> The strict isolation rules were designed with SARS-1 and it's prevalence in mind: a few sporadic and severely sick cases. Additionally a droplet and fomites transmission model was assumed, which makes isolation in an indoor room effective.

> In my opinion, in the case of targeted testing, those living in flats with small living spaces, which already have a greater infection risk, should not have additional constraints possibly hindering a healthy recovery and putting fellow occupants at risk.

 

The benefits of sports founded by biological mechanisms and epidemiological evidence are described on the [Movement page](../6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md).

Recommended articles regarding movement and exercise are:
* [Should, and how can, exercise be done during a coronavirus outbreak? An interview with Dr. Jeffrey A. Woods.](../6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md#zhu) by Zhu
* [COVID-19: A pandemic that threatens physical and mental health by promoting physical inactivity](../6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md#ali) by Ali and Kunugi 



## Recovery and Long Lasting Effects
[to be done]
Over 90 % of people are adverse effects free a couple of weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regarding athletes, countless have been diagnosed with Covid-19: Many of them competed in professional sports just a few weeks later and - to my knowledge - long-term adverse effects haven't been observed for any athlete. Athletes often have good fitness, do regular exercise and eat healthily . A healthy lifestyle including [movement](#movement) helps everybody to be in good health.

Nevertheless for some people a healthy life-style is not enough and some experience [long lasting effects](#long-lasting-effects). 

### Literature Recovery
* A recommended read is [Long COVID: A Primer for Family Physicians](#greenhalgh-nov2020) by Greenhalgh and Knight
* More detailed reads are [Management of post-acute covid-19 in primary care](#greenhalgh-aug2020) by Greenhalgh et al and [The Stanford Hall consensus statement for post-COVID-19 rehabilitation](#barker-davies) by Barker-Davies et al

### How to Recover
[in work]
How to optimally recover is addressed in papers listed in [Literature Recovery](#literature-recovery).

### Long Lasting Effects
Sometime long lasting symptoms such as fatigue and decreased physical fitness can occur, called long Covid/long-haulers. Tissues damage which needs some time to repair can be a cause ([Marshall](#marshall)). Another cause for long covid can be that immune system overshoots. To prevent the latter moderate [movement](#movement) can help.


## Fatality Rate

> ###### Infection Fatality Rate
> The *infection fatality rate/death rate* denotes the ratio of the people who die from the infection to all people overcoming the infection. 
> `ifr = #(deaths)/#(all infected)`

> *Fatality rate* on this page is used synonymously to [infection fatality rate](#infection-fatality-rate).

The fatality rate depends on the definition of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and a death cause by SARS-CoV-2. Both are not straight forward to define: 
* SARS-CoV-2 infections and diseases are described in the chapter [Diseases and Infections](#infections-and-diseases). Acute [Covid-19](#covid-19) are usually diagnosed by PCR tests and past infections detecting antibodies by serology. These methods don't agree in all cases: One can have a positive PCR test but no antibody in the blood or an antibody response in the blood without a negative PCR test in the nose (especially if measured only at a single time point) ([Diagnosis and Viral Load](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md)). 
* For many Covid associated deaths Covid is the main death cause. But for some cases the patients have other severe illnesses and to finally single out a death cause is difficult. Hard to estimate is also how many life years Covid takes.

Once agreed upon a uniform way to measure the fatality rate, the rate still varies considerably due to different populations structures (e.g. age, exposed air pollution, overall health, ...), medical systems, environmental factors and living conditions such as climate and air pollution. 


> ###### Case Fatality Rate
> The *case fatality rate* denotes the deaths divided by the official case counts: `cfr = #deaths/#(official cases)`
 
### Comparing Case and Infection Fatality
The official Covid-19 case counts are in most countries fare to low and thus the cfr fare to high. 
The resulting mismatch between cfr and ifr can be used to estimate the `detection rate = #(case count)/#(all infected) = [#(deaths)/#(all infected)] / [#(deaths)/#(cases count)] = ifr / cfr `
(more in the section [Detect Estimates Out of Bounds](../8_data/monitoring.md#detect-estimates-out-of-bounds) in the [Monitoring chapter](../8_data/monitoring.md)).

### Estimates
[in work]
* John Ioannidis infers the death rate from seroprevalence data across the world. Results:
  * 0.27% is the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate   (0.23% if corrected for the number of antibody types tested (immunoglobin, IgG, IgM, IgA))
  * 0.09% infection-fatality-rate in locations with COVID-19 population-mortality-rates less than the global average (< 118 deaths/million)
  * 0.20% infection-fatality-rate in locations with 118–500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.57% infection-fatality-rate in locations with > 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.05% infection-fatality-rate corrected median for people younger than 70 years

##### Background
* "Among nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, two-thirds are symptom-free by 14 days after symptom onset, and 90% are symptom-free by 21 days[2],[3]. The rest of patients experience persistent—or relapsing and remitting—symptoms, including cough, breathlessness, fatigue, fever, sore throat, nonspecific chest pains (lung burn), cognitive blunting (brain fog), anxiety, depression, skin rashes, and diarrhea. [4],[5]"
##### Treatment Recommendations
* "A social history may reveal relevant issues, such as isolation, economic hardship, pressure to return to work, bereavement, or loss of personal routines (e.g., shopping, church), which can impact patients’ well-being."
* "Those with persistent cough and breathlessness may benefit from simple breathing exercises (slow, diaphragmatic breathing with a 1:2 inspiration to expiration ratio several times per day)."
* "Because the role of exercise in recovery is controversial,10 patients should be counseled to pace themselves carefully and cut back if symptoms worsen. Specific guidance has been published for athletes returning to sports participation.10,13-15"
* "Mental health and well-being may be greatly improved by reestablishing social connections, community and peer support, and attention to structural determinants (e.g., measures to mitigate poverty, fight discrimination, and achieve social justice).16,1"

## Appendix
> #### Personal Covid Experience
> I likely had Covid-19 myself in early to mid March 2020 when temperatures were freezing cold in my living place at 1400 meters altitude. The initial experience was very different from a common respiratory disease and so diagnosis was not obvious, at least back then: 1) lack of respiratory symptoms - not a single cough if I recall correctly, 2) the supposed low prior probability according to the official prevalence and 3) I didn't want to have it and so was satisfied with not experiencing known and obvious symptoms. It first felt like a minor food poisoning but no vomiting or the like. Just felt strange for about two days. Soon the initial symptoms faded and I felt fit again. I went for some cross country skiing and much more intense than planned since three quarters were through deep snow. The sport session went well by itself, but it turned out to have been a bad idea: The following days some chills started and accompanied by a temperature increase, up to 36.x from my normal 35 degrees. But since I didn't record the temperature systematically before, the temperature measurements of 36.x degrees were calming instead of ringing the bells. Later the temperature further increased to 37.x accompanied by a strange sticky feeling in the chest; at this point I started to consider Covid as likely.
> Counting everything up it likely was Covid-19 and the sports session likely gave the viruses the opportunity to spread within the lungs. Noteworthy too: The day before the first symptoms was long and rather stressful, so the immune system likely wasn't prepared well to control the viruses initially. Immune response was still timely though: Less than twelve hours after the likely infection event (someone repeatedly coughing about 4 meters away in the same room and I was there about an hour and a half) the initial strange feeling started.
