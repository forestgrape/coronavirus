# Immunological Detection Methods
Immuno assays exploit that many proteins bind very specifically to each other (e.g. antibodies to antigens). 


## Lateral Flow Devices

Lateral flow devices work usually as follows [to confirm and cite]:
1. The substrate to test and some activation substance (called activator) are added.
    * If the analyte is present: The analyte binds to some marked substance, called marker here, e.g. marked with gold nanoparticles or fluorescence color. The analyte consists of proteins of SARS-2 in the case of an antigen test or antibodies against SARS-2 in the case of an antibody test.
2. The activator makes the marker flow through the device.
    * If the marker is bound to the analyte, the analyte acts as glue and binds the marker to the test strip. => Test strip gets positive
    * The marker or sometimes some second marker substance get bound to the control strip, which indicates that the substance have flown through the device in other words the activator has correctly induced the flow.

An antigen test works pretty much as shown above with the analyte being one of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins mostly the S protein. 
For antibody tests often the two classes of antibodies IgM and IgG are analyzed. Therefore these devices have two test strips since two analytes (IgM and IgG) are tested. The graphics by [Ghaffari et al](#ghaffari) shows such a device:
