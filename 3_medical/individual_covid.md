### Virion Shedding
* *Physiological:* Being infected does not imply one sheds infectious virions. The viral shedding depends on where the infection is and physiology of the respiratory tract. The virions need to be breath or coughed out. How many small particulates persons exhale is highly individual and tends to increase with age, male sex and BMI (described on in the section [particle source](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#particle-sources) on the transmission page. 
* *Behavior:* When one is infected how much the transmission paths are reduced is highly individual: 
  * some may notice symptoms and/or get tested
  * some are more and some are less careful
  * some have obligations such that staying home or out of public space is less doable, for others it's doable (e.g. in jobs where remote work is easy one can work from home at the slightest feel of uneasiness.)

* *The immune system preparedness to new viruses vary and some clear the viruses faster and earlier.*
  The immune systems vary between individuals. E.g. the immune system of young people can handle and control new pathogens and learns the new pathogens fast ([Immune System Adequateness](#immune-system-adequateness)).

* *Acquired Immunity:* The effects on acquired immunity on the transmission of new variants of SARS-2 are unclear (as of 14.7.21). Several options are possible:
  * Viral shedding for most is unlikely to change much. 
  * Possibly super spreading is reduced due to lower viral loads in the lungs but this needs to be confirmed. If super spreading is reduced, the overall spreading become more evenly distributed and might be lower.
  * Previous infected and vaccinated may feel safe and ignore precaution measures combined with inadequate immune reactions their spreading could increase.

  > Often is it assumed that vaccinated people are immune and not infectious, however this is *not correct* since it is known that vaccinated people can get infected and transmit the virus. -> [Vaccine Effects on Transmission](../10_vaccines/effects_on_s2_infections.md#transmission) are discussed in the Chapter Vaccines Effects.

### Immune System Adequateness
The immune system preparedness to new viruses vary and some clear the viruses faster and earlier.E.g. younger people tend to have an immune system which better and faster learns new pathogens and the the innate immune is stronger (the acquired immunity has the learn new pathogens by definition, so it needs to be learnable and the immune system needs backups to handle unknown pathogens since each pathogen is new on the first encounter) which can handle and control new pathogens quickly. Essentially SARS-CoV-2 is as new to them as any other pathogens. With increasing age to immune system becomes less adaptable (e.g. the number of naive T cells decrease) and relies much more on acquired immunity, in this case the immune response is often delayed and/or not adequate [citations coming]. Vaccination can provide preparedness.
