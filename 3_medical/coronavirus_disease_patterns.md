## Introduction to Coronavirus Disease Patterns
Coronaviruses cause infections and thereby induce induce different diseases: 
* The human endemic coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, NL63 and E229) usually infect the middle or upper respiratory tract.
* The coronaviruses directly emerging from zoonoses MERS-CoV and Sars-CoV-1 mainly infect the lower respiratory tract and sometimes the intestine. 

In the case of bovine coronaviruses it is observed that the same strains cause different diseases depending on the outbreak:
* Enteric disease (neonatal calf diarrhea, winter dysentery) 
* Respiratory disease (shipping fever and general pneumonia). 

Till the 90's it hasn't even been clear that both are cause by the same coronavirus since they occur often independent and usually do not transform into each other.


Similarly to bovine coronaviruses, the human coronavirus NL63, which usually causes upper respiratory tract infections, from time to time is involved in an outbreak cascade of lower respiratory tract infections. E.g. observed in old care homes [citation in work].

For Sars-CoV-2, different infection patterns are observed:  Virulent lower respiratory tract infections, similar to Sars-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV and subtle and often mild middle or upper respiratory tract infections similar to the four endemic coronaviruses. This yields the questions:
* What drives and causes the different infection location patterns?
* How to prevent and treat depending on locations?
* Which are complications and risks?
* What immune protections are raised in which circumstances. 

Regarding these questions the following hypotheses are stated and argued:
* Coronavirus can induce distinct infection patterns 
* The infection patterns are the result of and can be predicted by the factors:
    - the RNA sequence
    - the exact building blocks (mainly envelope lipids) and state of the virions (spike priming) which depend on the history of the initial virion[s] i.e. the cell and location they got produced and the physical, chemical and biological factors they have been exposed on their travel
    - the initial infection location
    - the host immune system and its experience with the virus strain
* The pathogenesis, possible complications and the optimal treatment depend on the infection patterns. 


## Infections Locations of Human Coronaviruses

##### Abbreviations
- LRI = lower respiratory tract infection (bronchioles, alveoli)
- MRI = middle respiratory tract infection (bronchi, trachea)
- URI = upper respiratory tract infection (pharynx = throat, mouth, nose)
- EI = enteric infection (intestine)

### Overview 

Infection Type| Coronavirus  | Symptoms | Immune_response | possible Complications| spread in body | Infection_Path | Immune_System_Preparedness and Particulars
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--
URI | NL63, OC43, HKU1, E229, (Sars-CoV-2) | Common cold: sore throat, upper cough, sneezing | often local T cells (Tissue resident T cells) which can migrate and protect the lungs, IgA antibodies | possibly longer lasting infection | LRI, local spread | droplet, aerosol | Immune system in the pharynx is used to viruses => milder symptoms and viruses need capabilities to evade/hide.
MRI | NL63, OC43, (HKU1), (E229), Sars-CoV-2| cough, enhanced temperature|IgA, local T cells (which can migrate to protect the lungs)|spread to LRI| LRI | coarse aerosol| immune system mostly prepared for viruses
LRI | MERS-CoV, Sars-CoV-1, Sars-CoV-2, (NL63), (OC43) | shortness of breath, fever, dry cough | local T cells if available and/else IgG antibodies, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, viraemia which can cause death | EI, blood| aerosol, dry form;transmission increases when much air is inhaled | immune system not well adapted to viruses and especially not to new viruses; the lung surface is big => lots of space to spread
EI  | Sars-CoV-1, (Sars-CoV-2), MERS-CoV, other?| diarrhea|  specific immune cells, some of them capable of producing antibodies | - | feces |through alimentary either by URI/LRI infections since the respiratory fluids are cleared to the stomach; direct oral intake | Adequate immune response, direct oral infection unlikely since the stomach acid destroys most virions 

> The coronaviruses directly emerging from zoonoses from outdoor living animals MERS-CoV and   Sars-CoV-1 infect the LRI and often spread to the intestine. The coronaviruses well adapted to our 'modern' way of life with dense population and in indoor rooms mainly infect to upper respiratory tract and ignore the intestine (Thoughts [on the origin](#on-the-origin)).


## Infection Locations by Coronavirus Species

### Infection Locations of SARS-1
The only location where _all_ patients had viral Sars-CoV-1 load are the lungs [Farcas et al](#farcas). 

### Infection Locations of MERS
For MERS-Cov [Memish et al.](#memish) found that both the viral load and the Genome Fraction obtained was higher in the lower respiratory tract (broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, tracheal fluid) than in the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swab, sputum). The three broncho-alveolar lavage fluid samples investigated, showed the highest average viral load and contained the most complete genome.
Remark: Mers-Cov has a different cell entry receptor (DPP4). However 
* the ability of a virus to efficiently takeover a cell depends not on the cell entry receptor alone. 
* some and especially the severe SARS-2 infections show a similar pathogenesis as MERS

### Infection Locations of SARS-2

#### Theoretical Deduction
* _Entry Point:_ Depending on the [transmission form](./../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#overview-transmission-models) of SARS-2.Virions enter through the respiratory tract
In the following the infections of Sars-CoV-2 are deduced from the [cell tropism](#cell-tropism-of-sars-cov-2) and the reachability of the tissue in question.


### Empirical Deduction
[in rework: update and a section for each strain]
The [viral loads](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) measured in combination with the [movements of virions](#movement-of-virions) inside the body can be used to backtrack tissue habitats of Sars-CoV-2.

## How to Determine Infection Locations of Coronaviruses
The task determine to habitat of Sars-CoV-2 can be tackled either 
* [Theoretical Deduction](#theoretical-deduction) taking into account the following topics:
  * _Entry Point:_ Where to virions enter initially.
  * _Tropism_: The ability of the entered virions to infect different cells and tissues. The tropism in turn are based on in vivo and in vitro experiments and empirical observations.
  * _Kinetics_: How produced virions are moved to reach new infectable cells and tissues. 
  * _Local Immune System_: the local immune surveillance.
* [Empirical Deduction](#empirical-deduction) based on observations of Covid-19 cases by [diagnostic methods](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md):
  * Measuring the viral load at different locations (Sometime the viral load needs to be corrected for the movement of virions.)
  * Detect tissue damage typical for viral infections and check e.g. by PCR the damage was indeed induced by a SARS-2 infection.

### Infection Locations and Immune Responses
[in work and partly **estimated/guessed**, citations coming/in search]

Infection Type  | Location | Symptoms | Immune responses | Comments and Risks/ possible complications/internal  spread  | Infection Path |
----|----|----|----|----|----
URI| Nose (nasal cavity / nasopharynx)| sneezing, loss of smell, headache, red eyes (especially if mask open towards the eyes)  |runny nose (mucus), local T cells or antibodies |  LRI, local spread| aerosol
URI| Mouth (oropharynx) | loss of taste | local T cells|  (LRI), (spread through olfactory route could occur)| droplet, direct contact, (indirect contact)
URI| Throat (laryngopharynx) |sore throat, upper cough | inflammation, local T cells|  LRI| droplet, aerosol
LRI | bronchi | strange feeling in the lungs, shortness of breath, fever, dry cough | antibodies, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, distribution throughout the lungs, (viraemia)| fine aerosol, dry form 
LRI | alveoli | strange feeling in the lungs, shortness of breath, fever, feeling sick | antibodies, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, viraemia which can cause death and spread to many organs| fine aerosol, dry form 



#### Not Infectable Locations
Not infectable since no ACE2 and thus the symptoms from the corresponding location indicate an **agent other** than Sars-2

[todo: merge with infection locations and add 'infectable column' e.g. ace2 column]

Infection Type  | Location | Symptoms | Immune response | Comments and Risks/ possible complications | Notes
--------------|--------------|----------|---------------|------------------------|---------------
MRI| Vocal folds | hoarse | - | no ACE2 cells thus no virus replication |
LRI | trachea | cough  | irritation due to virions deposited| no ACE2 cells thus no replication| viral load in sputum due to deposition

##### Findings
* Table 1 in the paper gives a concise summary of the availability of the receptors and proteases across the respiratory tract.
* "Here, we show that both HAT and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed with 2,6-linked sialic acids, the major receptor determinant of human influenza viruses, throughout the human respiratory tract. Similarly, coexpression of ACE2, the SARS-coronavirus receptor, and TMPRSS2 was frequently found in the upper and lower aerodigestive tract, with the exception of the vocal folds, epiglottis and trachea. Finally, activation of influenza virus was conserved between human, avian and porcine TMPRSS2, suggesting that this protease might activate influenza virus in reservoir-, intermediate- and human hosts."






## Appendix
### On the Origin
> The origin of Sars-CoV-1 is unclear: Related viruses are found in bats and even more similar in civet cats. However seroprevalence of antibodies in civet cats suggest that Sars-CoV-1 is not endemic to civet cats and thus there was a jump to civet cats around the same time (2002) when Sars-CoV-1 jumped to humans.
>
> The origin of Sars-CoV-2 is unknown. Considering its tropism, animal farming origin with frequent and even persistent infections of farmers seems possible. Goats or sheep could be the hosts of the Sars-2 viruses, possibly even of Sars-like in general. That Sars-CoV-2 was discovered  in a live-animal-market goes in line or a least is no contradiction with a farming origin: Rare severe cases in rural areas may not have rung the bells. However severe lung disease cases connected to a live-animal-market, triggered thorough investigations resulting in the discovery of Sars-CoV-2. The capable virology research facility in Wuhan may have sped the discovery.
> 
> Virus discovery is not easy and requires the right settings. Some of the settings often need to be guessed since the virus in question are unknown. The human coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63 have been discovered only in 2004/5 despite both being endemic to human for a long time and virologists had the (theoretical) possibilities to discover coronaviruses since the 70's. MERS got discovered in 2012 but likely human infections have occurred long before. 

> More on the origin is in the chapter [Backtracing SARS-like](../2_biological/hosts_of_nidovirales.md#backtracing-sars-cov-1/2)



### ACE2 Receptor
#### ACE2 Receptor Detection
There are two common methods to measure tissue distribution of proteins:
* ##### Antibody Staining
    Proteins on cell surfaces can be visualized by using marked antibodies. Several groups have analyzed tissues with ACE2 antibodies: [Timens](#timens), [McCray](#jia-2005), [soilleux, poehlmann](#summary-Bertram-2012)
* ##### Measure mRNA
    Measure ACE2 [mRNA](#mrna) expression. Necessary condition for a cell to produce a protein. However not sufficient for ACE2 on apical cell surface [to confirm]. The mRNA expression across the human body is shown in  [Li et al](#li).

##### Challenges for ACE2 Detection
[in work, verification needed]
For serving as an entry point, ACE2 needs to be built into the cell membrane as a receptor i.e. being useable from the outside. 

Since coronaviruses have a preference for [apical tissue sites](#apical-side-tropism) ACE2 should be expressed on the apical sites. 
* [Antibody staining](antibody-staining) alone can yield false positives if the cells are not properly cleaned and ACE2 is just attached to the cell without being built into the cell membrane. 
* [Measuring mRNA](#measure-mrna) just detects if the cells produces ace2. But proteins produced by a cell can  
    - stay in the cell e.g. in the cytoplasm or move into the nucleus
    - be released from the cell
    - being built into the cell membrane on the basal side or on the apical side as a receptor <= needed by coronaviruses. 

Receptor detection rules:
* If _both_ [receptor detection methods](#ace2-receptor-detection) yield true, this is very likely. 
* Antibody staining is likely enough if the 'receptor molecule' cannot be attached on the outside of a cell or if it can be cleaned away.
* Measuring mRNA is enough if the 'receptor' is always exposed on the cell membrane if produced and thus not reside intracellular.

#### ACE2 Receptor Distribution
[**incomplete and in rework**]
[recommended read is [Bertram 2012](#summary-Bertram-2012) where ACE2 receptor distribution obtained from tissue staining is described]
ACE2 is apically available 
* in the lower respiratory tract
    - well-differentiated and ciliated airway epithelia ([mcray05](#jia-2005))
    - alveolar epithelial type 2 cells [to check/find citation].
* in the upper respiratory tract
    - the basal layer of the non-keratinised squamous epithelium of the nasal, oral mucosa and the nasopharynx expresses ACE2 [Timens](#timens), [Lau](#lau) [in rework]. 
    - goblet cells [in work]
