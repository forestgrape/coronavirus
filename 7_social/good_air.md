# Good Air - Quality, Measurement and Certification

> brainstorming chapter just put here as ideas.

> A main goal of this chapter is to propose 'Good Air Certification'. Background: Sometimes indoor room entry is only allowed with a 'Covid certificate' with the intention to allow only the entry of people who presumably exhale less infectious SARS-2 aerosol. Often it is assumed, that this is the case for tested/vaccinated or sometimes vaccinated only persons. An alternative is to certificate the air quality directly without the detour of entry restrictions.

Covid demonstrates the importance of the air we breath: 
* Covid only spreads well if the air is not well ventilated/cleaned (can be checked with CO2 sensors/dust sensors)
* Severe Covid only spreads well if the air is dry (humidity sensors).
* Severe Covid spread is increased in regions with a history of air pollution.

(epidemiological evidence is described in the [Spread Analyses chapter](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) and the underlying mechanisms in the [Transmission chapter](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md)).

#### Current Air Humidity and Temperature
Regarding the transmission of Covid the air is ideally above 25 degrees and has a high humidity and a CO2 value close to the outdoor air value. However there are tradeoffs between these transmission constraints themselves and additionally the comfort feeling (air at around 22 degrees and 45% humidity is often assumed as comfortable) and the 'weathering' of buildings (e.g. condensation can cause walls to get mold).

* *Warm Settings:* The prevention of the spread of severe Covid is simple when the air is warm and humid: Opening the windows and turning off air-conditioners. The comfort can be decreased however. So a compromise would be to adjust the air to a temperature of around 27 degrees to a humidity of around 60%. 

* *Cold Settings:* In cold climates permanently opening the windows is usually not an option for comfort reasons. Even if the temperature comfort is given by good ventilation combined with heating, heating dries the air. So there is a tradeoff between low CO2 values and not very dry air indoors assuming the air is heated to a comfort level. Solutions are: humidification with ventilating or cleaning the air to reduce the need for ventilation.

#### Exposure to Air Pollutants
The short and long term exposure to air pollutants is relevant for the susceptibility to severe Covid and also influences the overall health:
* The Covid death rates are higher in regions which regularly have high air pollution. 
* Air pollution is generally relevant for susceptibility to respiratory infections.
* Air pollution can affect health in many ways e.g. increase the risk of arteriosclerosis.

    > This page about betacoronaviruses is mostly written in settings with clean air: In regions of Swiss Alps and pre alps and some parts - in the summer 2020 - also in the Austrian and Italian alps. Subjectively, I can better concentrate and have a better endurance in settings with clean air.


#### Air Quality Certification
Different properties of the air we breath can be measured:

Property | Measure by | Influenced by | Relevance
--|--|--|--
Humidity    | Humidity sensor | heating combined with ventilation, AC, humidifier | In very dry air the respiratory clearance is reduced, most viruses survive long, 
Temperature | Thermometer | heating, ventilation|comfort
CO2 content | CO2 Sensor| ventilation, breathing  | How much air is 're-breathed'
Particulate content | particulate sensor | outdoor air quality, ventilation, humidity, indoor particle sources, air cleaners| Cleanness of the air which indicate possible infectious aerosol and air pollutants/allergens.


#### Use Cases
Well adjusted air in indoor rooms/businesses (hotels, restaurants, shopping malls) provides:

* Reduce the overall burden of respiratory diseases.
* Supporting a good customer experience. Which can marketed (especially if measured/certified).


#### Summed up Benefits of Good Air
Properties of the air we breath are determinants for the spread of Covid but also for the spread of many other respiratory diseases. Additionally pollutants can be health hazards and allergens cause discomfort. So 'good' air not only reduces the spread of Covid but also of many other respiratory infections.
