# Individual Measures

## Considerations on Increased R Value
In my opinion, measures should  not target individuals and accordingly not be based on individual R values. Measures should target risky situations. Risky is mainly dry indoor air (chapter [Spread analysis](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md)). Dry indoor air can be ventilated, cleaned and humidified ([Good air certificate](../7_social/good_air.md)).

> I am aware that many (governments, scientists, doctors, parliaments, citizens) around the world assume that currently available intramuscular vaccines (e.g. 'mRNA' and 'Adeno-virus-with-spike' vaccines) are risk free and provide a useful protection against transmission. The supposedly reduced transmission and susceptibility is taken as a reason to restrict elementary rights and the freedom in varying degrees for those not vaccinated. While those vaccinated even at high rates of Covid hospitalizations are can do near everything even with symptoms and without antigen tests (// for airplane travel and large scale events I consider e.g. antigen tests as appropriate when hospitalization rates are high).

### Scientific Considerations
It is scientific task to determine the properties/features that predicts whether someone is more or less likely to be infectious. One such feature is being vaccinated. Another scientific question is, whether and which vaccines are safe. 


### Moral Considerations
Relevant moral questions are:
* Whether there should be restrictions for those being more likely infectious.
* The relations between opening the windows / keeping distance / wearing a mask / living healthily or unhealthily / removable chip implant / getting vaccinated / being young or old. 
* Who can say or has the right to say  something is safe, good or useful for somebody.
* How and by who, how fast and which risks are estimated and weighted.
* On different beliefs and world views.

> This is about *the present situation and the near future* and neither about the past nor the fare future. Sometimes historical comparisons are made. I think such comparisons fall short and are not helpful for an unbiased and rational discussion. E.g. in the middle ages the knowledge of natural sciences limited: Most diseases were not linked to pathogens and accordingly the transmission paths were often completely unknown. With todays knowledged many measures taking back then were not adequate or even harmful. Situations around the fascist regimes in Europe in the 30s and 40s were also fundamentally different.

With boosters some are more skeptical, but if adults are skeptical (with good reasons in my opinion regarding the short lived protection against transmission versus possible adverse effects) at the same time forcing teenagers to vaccinate is *not* nice. // On this page 'boosters' are not generally recommended. Forcing teenagers to vaccinate is considered a no go. (as of November 2021)


### Social Considerations
> To restrict basic human rights of selected people, needs in my opinion, both a very solid scientific foundation and an acute danger for public health. // Models predicting many cases in a few weeks or months is *not* an acute danger. Numerous modelling predictions published turned out to be wrong.

> To my judgement, there is no rigorous scientific foundation to differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons if not at risk for severe Covid: the science published suggests that intramuscular vaccines don't provide a protection against transmission for more than a few months. Thus the current restrictions of people opting out of vaccinations can be viewed as out casting people based on attitudes without a medical basis - at least in the case of people not at elevated risk for severe Covid, which includes all people below 30 years of age. For people at risk for severe Covid there is a risk of hospitalization but 1) transmissions of (severe) Covid often happen within residential block and 2) other behaviors which increase the risk of hospitalization need to be banned too. Also the long-term risk of the current vaccines is unknown and time-associated hospitalizations and even deaths are reported (//nevertheless for high risk groups one time vaccination is recommended on this page since severe Covid is severe). Also people can opt out of hospitalization/intense care and then this argument does not hold.// I don't think, it is nice to neglect (some) treatments (as commented in [Controlling>Strategy](controlling.md#strategy)), but is is a third option to experimental vaccination and to be out-casted from social life for months or more.

> Good treatment options would be nice, I am confident they will be available soon!
