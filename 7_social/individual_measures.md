# Individual Measures

## Considerations on Increased R Value
In my opinion, measures should neither be based on individual R values neither target individuals but target risky situations. Risky is mainly dry indoor air (chapter [Spread analysis](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md)). Dry indoor air can be cleaned and humidified if necessary ([Good air certificate](../7_social/good_air.md)).

> I am aware of the fact that many (governments, doctors, parliaments, citizens) around the world assume that currently available intramuscular vaccines (e.g. 'mRNA' and 'Adeno-virus-with-spike' vaccines) are risk free and provide a useful protection against transmission. The supposedly reduced transmission and susceptibility is taken as a reason to restrict elementary rights and the freedom in varying degrees for those not vaccinated.

### Scientific Considerations
It is scientific task to determine the properties/features that predicts whether someone is more or less likely to be infectious. One such feature is being vaccinated. Another scientific question is, whether and which vaccines are safe. 


### Moral Considerations
Relevant moral questions are:
* Whether there should be restrictions for those being more likely infectious.
* The relations between opening the windows / keeping distance / wearing a mask / living healthily or unhealthily / removable chip implant / getting vaccinated / being young or old. 
* Who can say or has the right to say  something is safe, good or useful for somebody.
* How and by who, how fast and which risks are estimated and weighted.
* On different beliefs and world views.

> This is about *the present situation and the near future* and neither about the past nor the fare future. Sometimes historical comparisons are made. I think such comparisons fall short and are not helpful for an unbiased and rational discussion. E.g. in the middle ages the knowledge of natural sciences limited: Most diseases were not linked to pathogens and accordingly the transmission paths were often completely unknown. With todays knowledged many measures taking back then were not adequate or even harmful. Situations around the fascist regimes in Europe in the 30s and 40s were also fundamentally different.


### Social Considerations
> To restrict people in basic human rights in my opinion both a very solid scientific foundation is needed and an acute danger for public health. // Models predicting many cases in a few weeks or months times is *not* an acute danger. Many modelling approaches published turned out to be wrong many times.

> To my judgement, there is no rigorous scientific foundation to differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons especially if not at risk for severe Covid: the science published indicates that the vaccines don't provide any protection against transmission for more than a few months. Thus the current restrictions of people opting out of vaccinations is to outcast people based on peoples beliefs and attitudes and not for medical reasons - at least in the case of people not at elevated risk for severe Covid, which includes all people below 35 years of age. For people at risk for severe Covid there is a risk of hospitalization but then other behaviors which increase the risk of hospitalization need to be banned too. Also people can opt out of hospitalization/intense case and then this argument does not hold. Furthermore the long-risk of the current vaccines is unknown. // I don't think, it is nice to neglect (some) treatments (also commented in [Controlling>Strategy](controlling.md#strategy)), but is is a third option to experimental vaccination and to be out-casted from social life for months. Good treatment would be nice, I am confident they will be available soon!
