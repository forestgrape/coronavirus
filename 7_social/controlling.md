## Summarized Transmission to Design Measures
The design of measures relies on transmission models. The dangerous transmission of Sars-CoV-2 is [airborne](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission) in dry air. A metaphor is to think of the transmission as smoke-like and those heavily infected release a lot of smokes.

### Indoor Transmission
*Observations:* The [spread pattern](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) shows that the cases of severe SARS-2 lung infections are high when a lot of dry air is exchanged between people which is the case in badly ventilated indoor rooms either heated (cold climates e.g. winters in Europe) or air-conditioned (very warm/sultry climates e.g. observed in Southern US in summer or regions of Brazil year round).

*Explanations:* In the air circulates around one breaths each others air. When heating, air-conditioning or the outdoor air is dry, the indoor air is dry. In dry air, tiny aerosol form. Tiny and dry particulates are most likely to be deposited in the deep lungs (chapter [Airborne Transmission](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md)). The [viability of coronaviruses](../2_biological/virion_viability.md) is also highest in dry particulates.

### Outdoor Transmission
*Observations:* On the other hand outdoors during the day, even in many crowded settings around the world (sometimes with masks, sometimes without), no increased spread has been observed (->[Spread Analyses](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md)).
*Explanations:* Outdoors the viruses get diluted and then either are cleared or decay. Due to decay and clearance there's no accumulation (->[Outdoor is Safer](#outdoors-is-safer)). Outdoors, the main transmission opportunity is droplet transmission in face-to-face situations. Droplet infections are unlikely to cause deep lung infections and therefore severe Covid is less likely (-> [Disease Pattering](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md).

### Seasonality of Transmission
The [spread in dry indoor air](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#summary) of coronaviruses (in fact most respiratory viruses) makes the spread seasonal: 
* Spread in the winter in moderate and northern climate regions. 
* Spread in the summer in hot & humid regions when air-conditioning is used.
* Spread during dry seasons in regions with extremely low air humidities (below 30%).

In moderate climate zones, prevention measures (doing Sauna, pay attention to ventilation, vaccinate risk groups) are important in the winter, can be relaxed during the spring, in the summer the risk is low and in autumn care needs to be taken. 

> I don't except strict measures to be necessary during Winter 2021 (-> [Looking Ahead](../1_introduction/situation_assessments.md#looking-ahead-may-2021)).

### Spread Metaphor
*Aerosol transmission* behaves [smoke like](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#metaphor-and-measures). 
* For aerosol transmission prevention non-smokers protections measures are suitable and necessary.
* If a smokers smoke can *not* be smelled the risk is low; else ventilation and good masks help. Smoke is rarely an issue outdoors, the same is true for Covid.

*Droplet transmissions* are micro spites and only happens when spitting into each others mouth is possible (droplet transmission is *not important* for the transmission of severe Covid). For droplet prevention distancing or plexiglas are enough.

### Differences between Individuals
* Some people are super-spreaders while many people don't spread Covid. 
* Children get less infected and are less infectious. No super spreading events have been linked to children.
* Vaccination does not prevent transmission once infected. While the current in use vaccines which are all administrated intramuscularly provide a good protection against severe Covid, these vaccines do *not* reliably reduce infection (likely not at all against the strains prevalent in Mid 2021).
* Symptomatic and severely sick patients are more infectious (The section [Infectors and Symptom Status](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#infectors-and-symptom-status) on the page [Spread Patterns](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md)).

  > => (Encouraging) Transparency is helpful and important.

### Summed Up
* Most covid transmissions occur in not well ventilated indoor settings. Indoor air which many people breath is in large buildings: E.g. stairwells in residential blocks, shared bedrooms, supermarkets, indoor arenas, large offices, cruise ships, airplanes (high altitude) or crowded bars.
* Outdoor activities reduce the overall Covid burden since: 1) More activities allowed. 2) Outdoor activities even can reduce the overall Covid spread and especially the number of severe cases, since less time is spent indoors and the lifestyles are healthier.
* Appropriate spread precaution measures and good treatment is important for people with severe Covid.

  > The stringency of measures needed is discussed in the section [Balancing of measures](#balancing-of-measures).

  > There's a helpful [aerosol FAQ](../1_introduction/illustrative_literature.md#aerosol-faq) from advisors in the US.


## Recommended Measure Packages
A short summary of recommended measure packages to reduce the Covid. 

> in work 22.8.

> Overall the recommended packages is subjective. While measures to reduce Covid transmissions can be [statistically analysed](../8_data/data.md#analyse-measures) to some extent, the weighting of the society costs is subjective.

### Year Round Measures
To prevent high rates of hospitalizations, some base measures can be adequate in risk regions.

#### Base Measures
* [Schools and Universities](#corona-conform-schooling): Regular ventilation and education on viruses and their transmission.
* Education on ventilation: Regular [ventilation](#ventilation) of residential blocks and education of caretakers how to ventilate.

#### Optional Measures
* [Nightlife](#reduction-of-nightlife) e.g. an early closure at 2 AM.
* Reducing (super)spreading by capacity, CO2 limits and/or masks (when possible) for large scale settings: These include large stadiums and shopping malls.
* Slowing down transmission associated with travelling, especially airplane travel: For airplane travelling one Covid test one or two days ahead of travel and one Covid test one or two days after arrival.
  * The tests should be done by everybody including those vaccinated else the spread of variants circumventing vaccination is promoted.
  * (Short-term) Business travelling is risky, no exception for tests.

### Summer Measures
* [Ventilation](#ventilation) maxed: Either keep the windows open or put the built in ventilation to max level. 
  > CO2 sensors or the like are good for winter when ventilation can not be maxed.
* No Air-Conditioning: Air conditioning dries the air which increases transmission.

### Winter Measures
* Appropriate [ventilation](#ventilation) either by a well adjusted and designed mechanical ventilation system or by opening the windows each hour.
* Humidification of indoor air in sensible settings:
  * Prevents that aerosol dry out (dried virions stay longer in the air, have a better survival and infect more severely)
  * The immune mechanisms in the respiratory tract (e.g. mucus clearance) work better if the air is not very dry.

## Mindset and Strategy to Tackle Covid 
> Mind set followed here to tackle SARS-CoV-2:
> * communication and explanation
> * knowledge & research
> * self responsibility, independent decisions combined with a circumspect lifestyle
> * Focus on overall life quality. This includes keeping overall health effects in mind: comparing different risks and the number of diseases and deaths caused, long-term damage, life quality cost (which can include economic costs).

> ### Strategy
> * Measures preserving life quality and health of everybody.
> * Keep the spread controllable and react if necessary. E.g. limiting super-spreader situation since they can yield sudden and hard to control explosion in cases.
> * Monitor and estimate overall cases to do predictions and planning.
> * Settings that those who want/need can protect, while those not needing/choosing can go on, go on circumspectly.
> * Avoiding hospital overwhelming. Since it is hard for all the affected: the relatives, the medical staff and the patients. At times when shops, restaurants and bars are open and crowded, risking with a high probability or considering *not* to admit elderly to hospitals I think is not nice. *Everybody has to right for a good treatment.*
>
> ### Reconsidering Strategy, Autumn 2020
> In cold areas/times rules need to be tighter, since aerosol transmission is hard to (self-)prevent at least if good masks are scarce. In warm areas windows should be open all the time and air-conditioning should *never* be used.
> 
> Three more points
> 1. Trying new paths but step by step and at the risk of falling having a parachute ready and using it early enough. Better walk with the parachute (and being ready for a new journey) than fall cool without. For Covid-19 the parachutes are outdoor days: being outdoors and avoiding all non essential entries to foreign or public indoor settings.
> 2. Doing experiments in limited/small settings.   
> 3. Analyzing missteps can be rewarding, the next antibiotics are to be discovered.



## Risk Management

### Balancing of Measures
> Here the goal is to minimize overall adverse health effects but *not* a zero-Covid. This includes unhealthy lifestyles motivated by overly strict measures or putting children at risk through vaccination and the unknown long term effects. However a very important goal is the avoid hospital overwhelming. 

> Regarding overall health, I my opinion, many countries should take measures towards clean air. It causes so many years of life lost and is nearly impossible to self prevent. Many countries have unhealthy levels of air pollution. There are countries - mainly in the Americas and in Africa - that do quite *well*.

> In regions with high air pollution the are more severe Covid cases ([Air Pollution](../5_epidemiological/individual_susceptibility_and_transmission.md#air-pollution) in Spread Analyses).

The stringency of measures if given by the following table ([Full Stringency Table](../8_data/monitoring.md#from-numbers-to-measures) for all infection rates on the [Monitoring Page](../8_data/monitoring.md))

C-Deaths/Million/day | Stringency
--|--
~.5   | if less or not increasing: loose rules, self responsibility
~1    | if greater and increasing: Prefer outdoors to indoors, **monitoring** needed. 
~2.5  | worrisome if greater and case count increases => tighten the rules, infection risk is increased due to many infected.

C-Deaths/Million/day = number of Covid-19 deaths per million inhabitants per day.

### On Balancing of Measures
> written in May to July 2020, updates to be done

* Monitoring the personal/frequent customers of open(ed) businesses can help to discover a new/increased Sars-CoV-2 spread. Representative samples twice per week should do the job.
* Step by Step adjusting helps to find a balance without many sudden/abrupt changes.
* All people belonging to a risk group for severe Covid-19 should be eligible to obtain free masks from pharmacies and doctors. The health care professionals should evaluate the model for a good fit and instruct the usage.
* Staff and patients of old-age homes, hospitals and similar institutions should monitor their health closely, watch for early Covid-19 signs and have easy access to Covid-19 PCR tests. Tests can also be used to do sampling to have an overview. Early action is important in these settings. Overall good life quality should be the goal, e.g. long-term prohibit visits is likely no solution.

#### Hospital Overwhelming
Reasons to avoid hospital overwhelming (with good planning some of the reasons can be overcome):
* Everyone has has the right for a fair and good treatment. 
* Opting out of (some) treatments on free will and without any pressure I consider a right too, but for doing so without any pressure, not overwhelmed hospitals are necessary. 
* The overall process can get less efficient. E.g. patients need out of hospital treatment, which has additional challenges.
* Can greatly increase the risk for additional spread since protection measures may not be in place. E.g. the provisional building may not have an appropriate ventilation and temporary personal can be more likely to forget about proper protection measures.



## Individual Protection Measures

### Support Immune Protection
Completely avoiding Sars-CoV-2 can be as hard as avoiding dust and smoke. This is hard. Even in laboratory settings virus protection is difficult [[Wurtz, Raoult et al](#raoult), [Artika and Ma'roef](#artika)] and  Sars-CoV-1/2 protection is difficult. There have been several cases of infections in labs with Sars-CoV-1 [Orellana et al](#orellana), [Lim et al](#lim) and recommendations for autopsies of Covid-19 fatalities are very strict [Finegan et al](#finegan). Out of labs, once a coronavirus is widespread, complete avoidance is nearly impossible. Sars-Cov-2 is widespread. The best protection available is a good immune system. Vaccines - ~~if once available~~ available in 2021 - just prepare the immune system and do not replace it. So the long-term focus should be to support the overall health of humanity. In tropical regions where Sars-CoV-2 infects less virulent but there are many more infectious diseases overall health should be the main focus - alongside always open windows and no air-conditioners if there are Covid-19 cases.

Proposals for good health:
* providing settings that support good health
    - allow people outdoors to move
    - environmental protection including clean air
* lessen stress 
    - secure and affordable life including basic health care
    - less pressure overall
* Healthy nutrition 
* Providing information and tips to focus on health and the immune system

There are many more good reasons good health - including an intact immune system - is important.


### Masks
Mask reduce spread since they mitigate both the infection and spread risk. Masks should be changed frequently but can be reused.
To prevent droplet transmission outdoors or in very well ventilated situations any mask helps. To prevent aerosol transmission indoors a good filtration and clean mask is necessary. The filtration of most surgical masks is ok. FFP masks or analog have good to very good filters. A good and dense fit is important, especially for masks with a high filtration. More on the page [Masks](../6_prevention_and_treatment/masks.md).


### Ventilation
Ventilation reduces the indoor airborne spread, since the virion density in [outdoor air](#outdoors-is-safer) is much lower than in indoor air. In sensible locations limits on the CO2 concentration and continuous monitoring ensure good ventilation (the indoor CO2 concentration is e.g. described in [Stocker](#stocker)). 

* [Escombe et al](#escombe) show natural ventilation is a valid measure and that in the first few minutes of opening the windows a major part of air is exchanged (Escombe: Figure 1:<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040068.g001>).
* [Salathe et al](#salathe) simulate the airborne (aerosol) and droplet spread of influenza based on observed contact patters of high school students. In the simulation, good ventilation is as effective as reducing transmission of half of the population. // in the paper vaccinate is used instead of reducing transmission. Reducing transmission is used here since there is evidence that influenza vaccines do not stop spreading influenza. Additionally transmission can be reduced in different ways e.g. by mask.


### Distancing
[Airborne transmission](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission) - both droplets (reek of alcohol like spread) and aerosol/dry particulates (smoke-like) - can be reduced with distancing. Outdoors or with good ventilation, less distance is required. So if inside 2 meters is good, outdoors likely half a meter is enough. Wind direction is relevant outdoors. Inside, the airflow can have a direction too: e.g. the kitchen hood and the toilet venting draw air.


### Large Buildings
Large residential block and office buildings special care needs to be taken, since the transmission risk is increased: 
* Epidemiological evidence: [Living Conditions](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#living-space-and-income) in the chapter [Spread Analyses](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md)
* Biological evidence: viruses can survive quite long at lower air temperatures without sunlight such as stairwells (chapter [Virion Viability](../2_biological/virion_viability.md)). 

Suggested precaution measures:
* Good filtration masks should be used in shared stairwells. 
* The stairwell should be ventilated regularly. 
* Flats/offices should be ventilated before opening the door to the stairwell, especially if sick.
* Easy access to Covid-19 tests.


### Covid-19 Cases and Quarantine
The focus should be on monitoring cases both for disease progression and to figure out and break chains of severe infections. 

> The strict isolation rules were designed with SARS-1 and it's prevalence in mind: a few sporadic and severely sick cases. Additionally a droplet and fomites transmission model was assumed, which makes isolation in an indoor room effective. However regarding the [aerosol transmission](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md) indoor isolation can backfire unless one lives in a single person house.

> In my opinion, especially in the case of targeted testing, those living in flats with small living spaces, which already have a greater infection risk, should not have additional penalties, which possibly hinder a healthy recovery and put fellow occupants at risk.


Relaxed rules are important for the [health of the infected and the possibly infected](../3_medical/covid19.md#movement) and in many situations relaxed rules are more efficient in reducing the spread.

#### Example Calculation of Spread

* ##### Strict Instructions
  With strict quarantine measures, infection risk from known infected is possibly lowered more but fewer people do tests. Example: Out of 10 infected, 5 are known and 5 unknown/untested
  * the 5 known may infect on average 2 others (thus having a R value of 0.4)
  * the 5 untested may infect 10 others (having a R value of 2.0)
  
  Overall the 10 infected people infect 12 others and so an overall R value of 1.2.
  
* ##### Relaxed Instructions
  With relaxed instructions the known infected may on average infect more people but the number of unknown infected is smaller. Overall this yields a smaller R value. Example out of 10 infected 8 are known and 2 unknown:
  * the 8 known infect 4 others (R value of 0.5 for known infected)
  * the 2 unknown infect 4 others (R value of 2.0)
  
  Overall the 10 infected infect 8 others corresponding to an overall R value of 0.8

Overall in the above scenario the relaxed instruction yield an overall lower spread since more people do testing/are transparent about symptoms.


#### Suggestions for possibly Infected
* mask wearing in all public indoor spaces and best in all indoor rooms where susceptible people can be.
* no crowded indoor spaces
* distance: 1 meters outdoors and 2 meters indoors.
* no face-to-face talking without a mask
* regular ventilation
* avoid excessive strains e.g. strenuous sports
* avoid indoor activities with heavy breathing/deep inhaling e.g. sport and singing/shouting

#### Suggestions for Infected
as for [Possibly Infected](#suggestions-for-possibly-infected) and additionally:
* [High-filtration mask](../6_prevention_and_treatment/masks.md#high-filtration) in all indoor spaces/rooms where people to protect are. Including the own building (stairwell e.g. for laundry/going outside) and the flat e.g. when living in flat sharing. The mask should be changed frequently.
* No crowded places (outdoors and indoors)
* Distance: 2 meters outdoors and 4 meters indoors.
* No close range face-to-face talking.
* Ventilate the room and flat before opening extern doors ([Large Buildings](#large-buildings)). Ideally ventilate before opening the personal room and open the door reduced.

#### Isolation by Home-Lockdown
To reduce spread isolation by home-lockdown is a radical measure. The more is known about Sars-CoV-2 and its spreading the more fine-grained the measures can be.
* Isolation should be used with care since it can discourage people from testing and being transparent e.g. disclosing socials contacts and travel history.
* There are good reasons against home isolation:
    - [Movement](../6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md) and sunlight are important for an intact immune system and good health. This is important for infected too.
    - Indoor movement/light sports can produce a lot of exhaled breadth condensate/aerosols and thus put people in the same building at risk.

  Preventing spread opportunities e.g. avoiding indoor and/or crowded public spaces is important.

Isolation by a stay-at-home-order may be working for people with own houses with gardens but for people living in flats in big buildings (and the majority of people do so in Covid risk regions), permanent home stay can increase transmission opportunities and has adverse health effects since movement is healthy.

### Testing Benefits

> **To be redone** (23.8.21). I opted here back in 2020 for benefit associated testing, it is widespread now in 2021. However not in the sense this was once intended and written back in November 2020:
> * The idea was to have easy accessible tests without 'punishment' upon a positive test result and motivation to take tests in *sensible* situations and not required testing for day-to-day life.
  >> In Switzerland antigen test are free to obtain in pharmacies (limited number per month) (not any more as of November 21). I consider this a good solution in sensible situations one can do a morning before breakfast test and if both are negative, changes are low for a Covid infection ([Covid Diagnosis](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md)).
> * In November 2020 the situation was different than now in than in August/November 2021: [Suitable immunisation options](../10_vaccines/immunization.md) for risk groups are available and promising treatments options are known, e.g. [interferons](../6_prevention_and_treatment/interferon.md). Topical methods such as steam inhalation may also be beneficial as proposed in a  brainstorming chapter on [Topical Treatments](../6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md).


Often turning up for test is not associated with any benefits, on the contrary if tested positive for Covid in many countries a home [isolation rules](#covid-19-cases-and-quarantine) apply and one needs to disclose contacts and possibly movement history. A different approach is whitelist testing e.g. those who test negative get benefits. 
* Experiences: 
  * Many countries require negative tests for entry. 
  * In Slovakia in early November 2020 a nationwide testing campaign and only those with negative tests were excluded from a general curfew. 
    > A new tactics and it will be interesting to analyze it. A general curfew I consider to strict in any situation including this. Only allowing people with negative tests to enter foreign indoor settings (e.g. gastronomy/offices) should be enough.

    ~~> A tactics like this could be applied locally in regions: Just those with negative are allowed to leave the region and enter foreign crowded indoor rooms.~~ this was to prevent home lockdown, long shutdowns and chaotic hospital overflows. This is obsolete as of August 2021.


### Outdoor Days
Avoiding foreign and public indoor rooms. Prevents aerosol transmission if care is taken in essential [buildings](#large-buildings) (e.g. shops and residential blocks) and public transport. ~~To prevent (the likely less relevant) droplet transmission, masks can be used for face to face talking outdoors.~~ outdoor transmission does rarely cause severe Covid


### Home-Lock Down
A general curfew is a radical measure. It reduces contacts and makes it easier to enforce a ban on entering foreign indoor rooms. This measure was mainly used in Winter/Spring 2020 when the information about SARS-CoV-2 was limited and transmission unclear. It has very severe drawbacks compared to [outdoor days](#outdoor-days):
* few or no movement for a longer time is not good for health and also increases the risk for severe Covid.
* it may increase Covid-19 transmission within residential blocks since most are forced to stay indoors. Especially when doing indoor sports a lot of air is in- and exhaled and so possibly infectious aerosol which puts fellow occupants and neighbors in the same building at risk. It's loose loose.
* being locked at home often has negative psychological effects.

A curfew at night is less radical and was sometimes used e.g. to prevent private parties but in nearly all situations softer measures are more adequate e.g. [Reduction of Nightlife](#reduction-of-nightlife).


### Temporary Financial Support
> written in autumn 2020, as of September 2021 I think closures are hardly ever adequate or necessary.

~~Some businesses will mainly be closed to break waves (e.g. gastronomy)~~ while other businesses likely are reduced for the foreseeable future such as long distance traveling or large scale events. For the first temporary support helps for the latter enabling better switching of business models is an option. Also some temporarily closed businesses, especially if closed for a longer time period, may not be able to return to the business model e.g.  the customer behavior can change.

As noted restrictions are dependent on the local situation and on the weighting/prioritizing of the benefits and costs, so Covid measures vary a lot between different regions.
 

* _Individuals:_ Temporary support for individuals I consider necessary not to disrupt livelihoods.
* _Closed Businesses:_ For businesses closed longer than about 2 months, I consider it appropriate to support the fixed costs: rent, insurances, capped salaries (if they are not yet covered by individual support). Temporarily credits are an option until which then can be transformed into a-fond-perdue support. The support for the fix costs can be proportional to the reduction in turnover (possibly averaged over some time period e.g. a year).
* _OPEN Businesses:_ Also businesses without formal restriction can struggle e.g. travel agencies. However unlike closed businesses there are chances to adapt. Easy credit access & realistic payback schemes combined with advices.

#### General Support
Additional to temporary support, general support and enabling for those who need or want to reorganize is adequate. How to take the corona-situation as an opportunity to reform the economical systems on the [economics page](../7_social/economics.md).


## Specific Public Measures
**(in work and currently more brainstorming)**

This sections discusses measures that can be put in place if Covid-19 increase rapidly. For each measure 
* ###### Evidence
  Epidemiological evidence: Have transmission events been observed in the setting? Can possible transmission events be reliable detected or will most go unnoticed?
* ###### ThinkThrough
  Thinking through/Common sense argumentation/Causal reasoning: Are there transmission opportunities? Are there protection concepts? Are the concepts realistic in practice?
* ###### Experiences
  Experiences with measures in place. Are there experiences and if so what are they?
* ###### Costs/Narrowing
  Narrowing of Life. How individuals experience the measures? Are indirect and/or future costs associated e.g. school children missing education. To cover financial costs of restricted businesses [financial support](#financial-support) is assumed.
* ###### Comment
  The points above are summarized to subjective rating/comments/recommendations. Subjective since they rely on subjective weighting and subjective rating of the single points. 


### Corona Conform Skiing

#### Summary Corona Conform Skiing
Nowadays (pre-corona) practiced cosy warm (après-)skiing is unsafe. The more outdoor the skiing-experience (including queuing & lifts & gastronomy) is the safer. Good ventilation can make the ski experience more outdoors like. Lowering the maximum crowd density is helps too, especially  indoors.

> My memories of skiing date back to the early 90s, back then a ski day was mostly outdoors from open-sky lifts to outdoor lunch.

> Allowing skiing in some regions first, I consider beneficial, since all can benefit from the experiences gathered. Ideally the situations are closely monitored (e.g. Covid-19 saliva-tests for travellers both on arrival and departure) and all experiences (concepts, monitoring results) are transparently published.

> International travelling can be connected to skiing but mostly skiing and international travelling are independent. Generally for travelling I think in place staying in case of an infection is important i.e. test before leave/travel (as of 30.11. not further discussed on this page).


__ThinkThrough__
Two sides:
* **Skiing itself:** Skiing down some slope has risks, however not virus infections. So regarding SARS-2 skiing itself is safe.
* **Skiing associated:** Skiing as practiced nowadays (before ~~corona~~ corona-measures) involves crowded cableway cabins and room, restaurants and bars and at all locations with different people from different regions and countries. Moreover all this at a very high altitude ( => deep breathing).
  
The points mentioned in skiing associated are known as risk factors for Covid transmission. Accordingly, without (adequate/aerosol) transmission preventions measures many transmissions have been linked to ski resorts in the winter 2020.

__Evidence__
In line with theoretical risk factors (high altitude, sports, dry air in densely populated indoor rooms) - without aerosol protection measures (disinfectants and some droplet preventions were already in place in winter 2020) - many infections occurred in ski resorts.

__Experiences__
In the summer 2020 many mountain locations in the alps were crowded and had running cable cars. To my knowledge no increased Covid-19 incidences and especially no hot-spots were observed.

=> In the summer season, when good ventilation is easy and often practiced and combined with low Covid incidence rates mountain holidays worked well.

__Comment__
Skiing itself is safe but there need to be restrictions on the high risk skiing associated settings. 

> To keep in mind, high altitude and sports increase the amount of air breathed and thus aerosol transmission.

* __cableways__: best unconfined=outdoors and if confined=indoor permanent open/removed windows.
* __tourism buildings__: 
  Transmission possibilities depend on [ventilation](#ventilation), since good ventilation prevents transmissions.
  * __with jackets__: In building where jackets are worn (e.g. cableway buildings, some sport-shops, self service restaurant where guests sit outside), ventilation can be permanent: Doors and windows are open allowing some draught. Aerosol transmission is efficiently reduced.
  * __without jackets__: In buildings where jackets are not worn (e.g. restaurants, tourist information). Regular ventilation e.g. each hour. Ideally there is a ventilation system or at least an adequate air-cleaning system installed. 
* __queuing__: 
  * Outdoors preferably; Indoor is queuing ideally avoided and if then very well ventilated.
  * Ticketing systems are tricky since they need to be working all the time: When everybody waits in the next indoor place when the weather is bad, effects can turn negative.

  > Yesterday (29.11.) on a mountain in the pre-alps: Common protection concepts were in place such as masks indoors (good: very well followed and mostly surgical masks), some (partly decorative) disinfectants and plexiglas, a 30% reduction in capacity, some ventilation in the cableways however not nearly as much ventilation as there could be. Concepts mostly worked until: Everybody - and there were many people since since only the mountains were out of fog - wanted to go down at the same time in the late afternoon. A large crowd lined up indoors. In the beginning an appropriate ventilation completely lacked, some even started feeling unwell. The air improved when doors and windows were opened.

* __Gastronomy__: Risks as described in the section [Gastronomy](#gastronomy). In ski resorts there are additional risk because of high altitude, guests from different regions and guests tend to go to many different gastronomy locations during a short time (often days).  
  * __indoor gastronomy__: High risk. Guests from the same villages/hotels going only to a limited number of restaurants helps to prevents chains of (super)spreading and helps contact tracing. 
    > Transmission risk is higher in indoor gastronomy/hotels than in cableway(-building) since in the latter ventilation by draught is possible since people can wear warm jackets (sport shops will cheer) and wear masks. But for indoor gastronomy masks, draught, jackets & masks fit less. Ideally some ventilation system is in place.
  * __outdoor gastronomy__: Low risk. Ideally masks are used when getting/bringing food/drinks or going to toilets. 
  * __apres ski__:
    * __indoor__: very high risk often dense crowds and a lot of alcohol (see also indoor gastronomy)
    * __outdoor__: low to medium risk with some distance and limits on alcohol
* __masks__:
  * __outdoor__: any mask including cloths masks and scarf-like to prevent droplet transmission e.g. for staff. 
  * __indoor__: surgical masks or above ([Mask Types](#mask-types)) since:
    *  __Increased Aerosol Transmission__: At high altitude combined with sports, the aerosol transmission is increased.
    *  __Good filter__: Cloths masks, scarfs and so on are hard to distinguish and some of them don't hold back virions in aerosol efficiently. Even good cloths masks offer less [filter performance](#filter-performance) than most surgical masks. 
    *  __Clean masks__: Mask likely offer better protection if fresh/clean [clean masks](#clean-masks). So it is better to go skiing with a bunch of surgical masks and rotate them.

  > Recently I read I a comment from a speaker from a Cableway Association, reading something like: "We cannot and must not control whether people wear clean or the right masks, we trust on the own responsibility." 
  > Several points:
  > * Everybody should encourage and motivate everybody to take good protections. If control is helpful or needed, the system needs to be or at least attempted to be designed such that controlling is possible.
  > * Aerosol transmission plays a role in the transmission of Covid and many cloth masks offer only few protection versus aerosol. // I avow, this is still disputed to some extent. 
  > * Own responsibility is for everyone including operators. If there are few official rules, then there are many specific situations with no general/official rule (e.g. on the mask type). In sensible situations, it can be adequate to set additional rules or do more checks.
  

### Reduction of Nightlife
A reduction of nightlife can reach from an early closure of clubs to a complete stay at home order at night. 
* Evidence:
  * Many anecdote-like Covid-19 spreading events including super spreading events have been linked to nightlife ([[Indoor Social Settings in Spread Analyses](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#indoor-social-settings)). 
  * That in many countries only few infections can be traced back to nightlife in comparison to transmissions in family settings or private parties can be attributed to trace and test schemes: Contact tracing and testing just works better in family settings. For a club with infected attendees, one week later every attendee should be tested, to my knowledge this is hardly done. In regions with low case counts and extensive contact tracing (e.g. South Korea and Hong Kong) many infections have been traced to nightlife [citations in work].  
* ThinkThrough: Nightlife is about socializing. With loud music distancing is hardly doable. Drinking is common, a risk factor by itself, also prevents mask usage. 
* Experiences:
  * An early closure of nightlife was implemented in (exact measures to be checked, combined with other measures/recommendations)
    * Greece, 11.8.20: closing between 12 pm and 7 am, in risk regions: Athens [to check])
    * Denmark, 15.9.20: closing at 10 pm in risk regions, recommendation to reduce social contact and ending private parties at 10 pm
    * Spain, 14.8.20: closing of nightclubs, bars and restaurants close at 1 am, no drinking on the streets
    * Netherlands, Summer 2021: Netherlands opened (accompanied with test/vaccinated entry only) and then closed back again the nightlife after observed superspreading. In the following the hospital cases stop increasing [to confirm and cite].
  
    Two weeks after this measures the incidence of Covid cases flattened in all the above countries. 
    ##### Remark
    Denmark and Greece implemented this measures at low Covid incidences. Spain introduced additional measures later on. 
* Comment: In pandemic times a closure e.g. at 12 pm like implemented in Greece is reasonable; more strict depending on the situation e.g. risk of hospital overflow.  

> I recently (Mid October 2020) read in the news, that people clubbing at 6 am in the morning had to go to quarantine because of a positive guest combined with a faulty guest list.
> 
> Partying until 6 am and likely drinking a lot is not wanted, since protection measures are hardly followed and the immune system is burdened the next day repairing party-damage and may not fight viruses. This is double bad:
>   1. Disease progression: Longer asymptomatic phase and higher viral load.
>   2. Feeling unwell the next day(s) is common and so possible Covid symptoms may be attributed to the party night and therefore are not recognized.

### Reduce Alcohol Consumption
The history of prohibition dates back nearly as long, as history has been handed down. Full prohibition never really worked. Today many countries have increased taxes. The taxes mostly are high enough to reduce consumption but low enough such that smuggling doesn't pay off. 
* ThinkThrough:
  * Drinking a lot of alcohol diminishes the immune system. Alcohol can prevent recognizing symptoms either by reduced sensitivity or wrong attribution.
  * Alcohol reduces the ability to concentrate and rashly actions are more common, that's why no driving. Permanent following of corona prevention measures needs concentration.
* Comment: 
  * Non alcoholic drinks should be noticeable cheaper than alcoholic ones.
  * Depending on the situation a selling stop in the late evening/night can help.


### Gastronomy
* _Evidence:_ Where the transmission chains have been analyzed (e.g. Hong Kong, South Korea) [citations in work], transmissions have been backtraced to gastronomy (usually bars in the evening, see also [nightlife](#reduction-of-nightlife)).
* _ThinkThrough:_
  * Many people from different backgrounds and regions sit often densely in the same room. Especially in bars, the ventilation tends to have a lot of space for improvement.
* _Comment:_
  * Good ventilation and not overly crowded
  * In regions where the death rate is above 2.5 per million and cases are increasing, reduction of gastronomy at least in the later evening (section [Reduction of Nightlife](#reduction-of-nightlife)) can help to reduce the case counts.
  * Outdoor gastronomy is no risk and may even reduce transmissions since more time is spent outdoors (also commented in [Corona Conform Skiing](#corona-conform-skiing) and [Transmission Summary](#summarized-transmission-to-design-measures)).
  
  > Gastronomy likely contributes much less to the spread than large scale events, business travelling or nightlife. With good ventilation concepts, transmission risk is likely similar to supermarkets, stairwells, underground car parks or public transport.
  
  > In emergency situations closures can be adequate, but even then some gastronomy can be left often for those needing them (e.g. living/working alone/not working (e.g. due to Covid)/needing for other reasons), but for most gastronomy dispensable for a few weeks. // as of 20.8.2021 emergency situations are not excepted any more. One reason is the transmission pathways are known and with adequate measures such as good ventilation most transmission risk can be prevented. Emergency measures have been sometimes necessary as a last fall-back in 2020 when the recommended protection measures not adequate such as disinfectants.

  > People working in large groups (e.g. open-plan office) or living in large groups (e.g. families) should take special care regarding Covid-19 transmission in gastronomy since they already are possible angle points for transmissions.



### Corona Conform Schooling

> As of 6.6.21 in Europe with risk groups vaccinated, protections can be relaxed. Children get only mild Covid anyways. Vaccination for children is strongly discouraged here, the mRNA vaccines are magnitudes of order more risky for children than Covid.

> As of 23.8.2021: Good ventilation is the basis. Additional measures depending on the epidemiological and regional situation: Possibly masks. Possibly regular testing with a focus on teachers. Measures tailored to the local situation should work fine since students and teachers normally attend only one (or sometimes two) school(s). Continuity in time (at least a few weeks) helps acceptance and clarity. Schools are  places to communicate & explain.

> mostly written in October 2020 during a Corona wave peak in Europe.

Measure regarding schools can reach from complete closure to mild measures such as wearing face-masks in breaks.
* _Evidence:_  ~~In Israel the reopening of schools seems to have contributed to increased spread~~ **Correction, 24.10.20**: There have been infection clusters in high schools (which have been probably caused by infected teachers, see [Summary Stein-Zamir](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#summary-stein-zamir)). But I could *not* find any evidence that the rise in cases after reopening the entire country (not only schools) can be causally linked to schools, neither in Israel nor in any other country. 
  > The early-on update ([Updates 16.10](../1_introduction/update_history.md)) was too early, I didn't read and lookup the sources carefully enough. 
* _ThinkThrough:_
  * Children are **not** main spreaders in the sense that there R value is low [Observations for Schools and Children](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#schools-and-children).
  * Biological Background:
    * The SARS-2 receptor ACE2 is not expressed on the vocal folds unlike the influenza A receptor. Therefore aerosol produced when talking are less infectious compared to influenza. 
    * SARS-2 causing severe Covid is mainly spread from the lower lungs but children exhale only rarely particles from the lower lungs and additionally the lungs are rarely infected in children since their immune system is strong. So if children spread then mainly with droplet transmission which can be easily prevented.
  * However:
    * Even with a low R value children can contribute to the overall spread.
    * Many people in the same room and classrooms are not always ventilated well.
    * ##### Close Talking
      Many face-to-face talking situations with many different people. 
      > Comment, 4.11.20: all evidence points SARS-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted through aerosols from the lung and *not* with particulates produced when speaking. 
      > Comment 29.5.21: The SARS-2 spread is different from influenza spread which infects the vocal folds.
    * Children all come from different families and inside families protection is not easy but doable if the infection known (children are not super-spreaders).
* Experiences: 
  * School closures were part of lock/shut-downs in spring 2020 in many countries. Mainly due to experiences with influenza, but influenza transmission is different. For SARS-CoV-2 ~~there's evidence, that~~ school closures have little effect. What has been clearly observed however are negative impacts: on the learning experience, on the pupils and the parents/families.
  * In some schools mask wearing is common, negative comments are few
  * Project based and individual learning are common teaching approaches and known to work. 
* Comment: Children [spread Covid-19](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) less since they produce less aerosol and have better immune responses. So in areas which struggle with severe Covid situations, instead of complete closures, transmission can be efficiently reduced or even prevented by:
  * Masks when face-to-face talking e.g. in breaks //6.6. may not be necessary for Covid see comment [close talking above](#close-talking)
  * Fewer Exams, Projects can be graded
    * Exams can cause stress. With stress, coronaviruses get forgotten both by the immune system and the behavior.  
    * With common cold like symptoms, one  usually doesn't skip an exam. In Covid times it is important to stay home. On the other hand, skipping an exam on purpose is also easy, some respiratory symptom will pop up. 
  * No talking exercises and more focus on written tasks. 
    * Showing educational movies. 
    * A good time to learn, respectively teach, programming and other computer skills. For computer skills there are many good self learning resources. 
  * More  individual than group work. If group work, then the groups should not change daily (weekly should be ok).
  * Outdoor sports
  * Relaxed presence requirements. E.g. students/pupils can be given tasks and the tasks can be done remotely. Projects can be rescheduled and started earlier. 
  * Library like settings/managed self-learning can be an alternative to closures: students just come to learn/work/read and somebody is there to help when needed (teacher - student protection measures may work better than student-student). Pupils/students can come to read, even if it's reading the favorite book.

### Outdoors is Safer
Outdoors is safer because of:
- [Virion Decay](#virion-decay): Virions decay fast since sunlight, high temperatures and a variety of chemicals and biochemicals damage the virions and without metabolism they can't repair themselves.
- [Dilution](#virion-dilution): The virion density decreases rapidly due to the air exchange. 
- [Virion Clearance](#virion-clearance): Humidity, rainfall and abundant attachment surfaces clear the air from virions. Once attached to natural surfaces, there are countless microorganisms nourishing from anything digestible.

#### Virion Decay
The virion decay is fast compared to other forms of life since they are fragile and can't repair any damage. Exposed to  disinfectants or soap most virions decay within a minute. Sunlight and high temperatures also render the virions un-infectious with a halflife time of a few minutes. The virions survive longest in dry air without sunlight. Even on cloudy days and towards the evening the virion halflife time is about 10 minutes.

> Even our stable DNA in the inner layer of the skin, protected by outer layer of the skin which contains light absorbing melanin (the more light absorbing melanin the less sunlight reaches the inner layer of the skin), a cell membrane and inside the cell nucleus takes damage from exposure to UV. Unlike virions we also have an advanced repair mechanism which often can put things right again.

> A detailed description of the coronavirus decay is on the page [virion viability](../2_biological/virion_viability.md). 

#### Virion Dilution
Outdoors there is much more air per person than inside:
* In an indoor room with 3 meters high and each person has a distance of 2 meters to the next, there are 12 cubic meters of air per person.
* Even in the most densely populated cities the population density reaches at most 100'000 person per square kilometer. Assuming that only the lower 150 meters of air are mixed, this yields an average of (1'000'000 m^2 * 150 m) / 100'000 persons = 1500 cubic meters of air per person. <!--Compared to an indoor room with a high of 3 meters this corresponds to a distance of 22 meters to the next (if only aerosols transmission and not droplet transmission is taken into account). -->
* Large areas/entire world: Assuming a mixing of air in the lower 1500 'density meters' and an average population density of about 15 persons per square kilometer:
(1'000'000 * 1500 cubic meters)/15 persons  = 100 million cubic meters of air per person.

#### Virion Clearance
Virion are cleared from the air by the mechanism below and due to virion decay there's no accumulation:
- [Virion Decay](#virion-decay) in air: occurs mainly through sun light
- Condensation 
- Washed out by rain
- Virion attachment to non infectable materials which are non living things such as earth, water or rocks or living things which cannot be infected e.g. coronaviruses can *not* infect plants. So outdoors, the vast majority of surfaces are not infectable.
