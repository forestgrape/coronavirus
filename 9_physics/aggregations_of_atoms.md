# The Structure of Matter - Topics on Aggregations of Atoms

> in work, incomplete, some parts are explorative and need to be checked


> Currently (May 2021) collection of topics of atoms arrangement relevant for other part of this page. The topics are sketchy and incomplete. Long-term goal: Description how atomic elements arrange to form inorganic or organic matter.

## Summary
Chemical elements achieve a stable electron configuration (octet rule (of thumb): usually 8 electrons on the outermost electron shell) by 
* taking up electrons or giving electrons away => charged particles =: ions
* sharing electrons => atoms coupled together by electron bonds =: chemical molecules

Ions, chemical molecules and inert elements are denoted here as generalized molecules.

Generalized molecules interact through intermolecular forces. These intermolecular forces determine how matter is arrange and what properties it has.

## Nuclear-Physical Topics

> ##### Atomic Core
> An aggregation of protons and neutrons.

* The charged protons determine the interactions with the electrons.
* The combination of protons and neutrons determines how stable the atomic core is.

## Chemical Topics
> ##### Atom
> An atomic core surrounded by electrons.  a specified number of protons and neutrons together with electrons matching the number of protons.

##### Chemical Reaction
A chemical reaction is when atoms exchange or share electrons.

Specific atoms can neither be broken nor be transformed by chemical reactions thus they are called chemical elements:

> ##### Chemical Element
> An atom of a specific type or a aggregation of all the same type atoms.

Chemical elements are grouped into metallic and non-metallic. The metallic usually release electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration and the non-metallic usually take or share electrons.

Two or more atoms which are bound together by sharing electrons in an electron bond are called molecule:

> ##### Molecule
> Atoms bound together through electron bindings such that the overall electron configuration is stable.

## Physical Topics

Atoms react in chemical reactions to achieve stable electron configurations. The resulting chemical products then are the units which to form matter. 

> ##### Generalized Molecule
> ##### Physical Unit
> A particle with a stable electron configuration is denoted as *generalized molecule* or *physical unit*. 


The idea is that a generalized molecule is a constant for physical transformations such as solute, state transition, crystallization and can only be changed by chemical reactions.
* Regarding classical mechanics and thermodynamics a generalized molecule is the unit of motion.
* Molecules can only be changed trough chemical reactions but not through physical processes (except)

Examples of generalized molecules:
* Chemical molecules such as H2O, CH4 or proteins when atoms achieved a stable electron configuration by sharing elements.
* The inert elements such as helium (He) or argon (Ar) which already have a complete outer electron shell.
* Ions with a complete outer electron shell e.g. the units of salt which are Na+ and Cl-. They can be arrange fixed forming a salt crystal or be dissolved in water where each Na+ and Cl- is surrounded by water dipoles such that opposite charges match.



### Properties of Intermolecular Bindings

##### Bindings induce Fixed Positions
The atoms can *not* move respect to each other without breaking the bindings.

-> Solid matter

##### Bindings induce Fixed Distances
Generalized molecules interact through intramolecular forces (which are minimized at a certain distance). The average distance between molecules is constant but the molecules move freely  with respect to each other.

-> Liquid

##### Bindings induce Locally Fixed Bindings but the resulting Blocks have only Fixed Distances

-> Liquid

##### No Bindings
> Generalized molecules fly around freely and only interact upon collision.

-> Gas


### States of Matter
* Solid
* Liquid
* Gas

### Changes Intramolecular Bindings

### Evaporation

##### Evaporation Process
> The process when molecules from a liquid escape the intramolecular binding to move into the gaseous phase.


### Condensation


##### Condensation Humidity
>> The condensation humidity for a particle denotes the relative humidity at which droplets noticeable growths due to condensation.

If the droplets consist of pure water, the condensation humidity


### Efflorescence

##### Efflorescence Process
> Efflorescence is the process when dissolved matter crystallizes. 

Usually efflorescence happens because of evaporation of water out of a solution. E.g. when enough water evaporates from a sodium chloride (common salt) solution, the sodium chloride crystallizes into many tiny crystals which all reflect light (white color).

##### Efflorescent Humidity

> The efflorescent humidity-point for a homogenous solution is the humidity at which the solute crystallizes.

Notes:
* The efflorescent humidity depends on the solution e.g. proteins, salts and fatty acids in a solution are determinants of its efflorescent humidity.
* For a solution containing different solutes not all solutes may crystallize at the same humidity. Thus the efflorescent point is cannot be precisely given for the entire solution.
* For respiratory tract fluids it is about 35 to 40%. 

> // The efflorescent humidity is likely lower for upper respiratory tract fluids and higher for LRT fluids [to confirm and cite]. // Guess: about 40% for LRT fluids and about 25 for URT fluids.

 is 100% by definition of the relative humidity.



## Biological Topics
### Break Points in Life Forms
Life forms can loose viability either when the molecules themselves or their structure and arrangement are broken.

## History and Relation of Biology, Chemistry and Physics
> [in work]
> Historically biology, chemistry and physics evolved as separate scientific disciplines with the tasks:
> - Biology: Observing and describing living organisms.
> - Chemistry: the successor of alchemy (the transmutation of metals from greek al=the and khÄ“mia=transmuting metals). Chemistry is about transmuting and disassembling substances.
> - Physics: Movements and forces on solid objects. Early handed down descriptions and experiments were done by Archimedes and Galileo. Newton mathematically described the observed planetary motions as the movement of objects rotating around the sun subject to gravity. From that point on physics dealt with distance forces influencing the acceleration of objects. This approach turned out to describe many phenomena in nature.
> 
> Concepts from physics (movements of particles, behavior of waves, forces and related concepts) can be used to model/explain nearly every phenomena observed.
> The underlying mechanism of chemical reactions are explained by the behavior of the outer electron shells of atoms which in turn can be described by quantum mechanics. Mostly these underlying mechanisms can be abstracted away however and chemistry describes how atoms react with each other. Molecular biology in turn is the chemistry of molecules only occurring in the context of life forms. The building block of life can be described by molecular biology. Life forms, which are complex constructs huge numbers of these building blocks, show phenomena that are often best described by abstracting away the building blocks. So physics, chemistry and biology describe different parts of nature.
> 
> Physical, chemical and biological are used here as follows:
> - ##### Physics
>   Physics is about the behavior of particles and bodies and how they interact with each other to change their movements and states. The behavior of particle systems (many particles which interact) is often easier/only doable by considering the entity and not single particles.
> - ###### Chemistry
>   *Chemistry* describes reactions of substances. *Chemical reaction* = changes in the electron arrangement of the outer electron shells.
> - ###### Biology
>   * Classical Biology studies life-forms including their relations, their behavior and habitats.
>   * Molecular biology is essentially the chemistry occurring in the context of life forms: Reactions and participating substances occurring only in the context of [life forms](../2_biological/life-forms.md#life-form) on earth. Mostly these are complex organic molecules and their reactions.
