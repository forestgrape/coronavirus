## Summary
[**in work and incomplete and to be checked**]

Selected topics of the immune protection with a focus protection versus coronaviruses are discussed.

###### Immune System
> The *immune system* denotes organs and processes that keep the body and metabolism free of unwanted things either by preventing entry or getting rid of them.

Nearly all forms of life have some immune mechanisms. Even viruses encode proteins to stop the host from interfering with their metabolism: The host immune system tries to stop the virus metabolism and the the virus immune system in turn tries the stop the host immune system.

Immune mechanism can be classified according to various criteria:
- [Immune System Goals](#immune-system-goals): Prevent entry | eliminate unwanted | supervise metabolism.
- [Immune System Mechanism](#immune-system-mechanisms): Physical, chemical and biological mechanism are in use.
- [Immune System Specificity](#immune-system-specificity): Which substances are recognized and targeted. Substances that are ignored.
- [Protection Locations](#protection-locations): Local or global. At frequent foreign substances entry points many local protection mechanism are in place.


## Immune System Goals
[in work and incomplete]
As [defined](#immune-system) the immune system task is to keep the metabolism free of unwanted things. Different part of the immune system have different goals/tasks:
* [Prevent Entry](#prevent-entry)
* [Detect and Eliminate Unwanted Things](#detect-and-eliminate-unwanted-things)
* [Prevent Unwanted Metabolisms](#prevent-unwanted-metabolisms)

### Prevent Entry
Against many pathogens a physical barrier is the most effective line of defence. Where possible this defense mechanism is in place. However where a an exchange of chemical and biological substance is needed no complete physical barrier is possible but other obstacles are in place:
* alveoli in the lung: exchange of oxygen => the respiratory tract evolved such that most particles don't reach the alveoli, described in [Particle Dynamics in the Respiratory Tract](./transmission.md#particle-dynamics-in-the-respiratory-tract).
* Intestine in the alimentary => To take up nutrients the intestine needs to  be permeable to chemical and biological substance and the substance also need to reach it. To reduce the amount of pathogens reaching the intestine, the acidic stomach is in front of the alkaline intestine.


### Detect and Eliminate Unwanted Things
Unwanted can mean:
- foreign substances
- cells considered out of order
- things classified as being harmful. These are often specific parts of proteins.

### Prevent Unwanted Metabolisms
In some cases preventing unwanted metabolism is done by eliminating whole cells, in that case preventing unwanted metabolism yields eliminating unwanted cells and so is a special case of [eliminating unwanted things](#detect-and-eliminate-unwanted-things). But often the immune response is more fine-grained e.g. silencing foreign RNAs.

#### Self-checks
[in work]
Self checks of the cells: inside the cells there are various systems to keep to cells metabolism immune.
* RNA silencing
* Detect foreign RNA e.g. double stranded
* Detect stress e.g. Ribosome permanently producing. 

#### Extern-checks
Cells present what they produce on the outside: T cells inspect these substances and can induce cell death or ring the bells. In fighting coronaviruses T cells play a key role [citations in work].


## Immune System Mechanisms
The mechanisms can be classified by the mode of action either physical, chemical or biological. The relations between Physics, Chemistry and Biology are sketched in [Biology, Chemistry and Physics](#biology-chemistry-and-physics).

### Physical Mechanisms
* protecting layers: dead cells on the epithelium (e.g. skin)(The outer layer of the body = the surface of the body = anything that can be reached while the body) is not injured - is called epithelial layer and the cells epithelial cells i.e. the cells on the surface. This layer has often various protections e.g. dead cells (which is the case for the skin) 
* mucus clearance:
  * middle and upper respiratory tract
  * many parts of the alimentary tract
* [Immune System Goals](#immune-system-goals): mainly used to prevent entry, sometime to eliminate substances.

### Chemical Mechanisms
 * change of pH e.g. acidic fluids (e.g. stomach acid) or alkaline environment (e.g. small intestine)
 * degradation of substances by hydrogen peroxide
 * [Immune System Goals](#immune-system-goals): often used to prevent entry (stomach) or eliminate substances.

### Biological Mechanisms
Recognizing biological substances as unwanted and eliminate them. Unlike chemical and physical mechanisms biological mechanism can specifically recognize substances and thereby distinguish different life forms and even self and non self. 
[Immune System Goals](#immune-system-goals): Often the recognizing part is carried out by biological mechanism which allow specific targeting and the elimination part is then chemical or physical. 


## Immune System Members

### T Cells
* T cells are in the blood and locally in tissues. 
* T cells can check if cells do what they are supposed to do. Virus infected cells have a changed metabolism e.g. produce virions, which can be [detected by T cells](#extern-checks).
* To control coronaviruses infections T cells are key [citation coming].

> ###### Local T cell
> *Tissue resident T cells* in literature, called *local T cells* on this page, are T cells which survey the tissues cells integrity. They move within tissues and and do not circulate with the blood.

#### Distribution
Local T cells are located often at entry points for pathogens. E.g. the mouth is a common entry point for viruses, so in the mouth there are many local T cells [to check and cite].

## Protection Locations
Immune responses can be global (affecting the entire body), local for some tissue or even inside single cells:
* entire body (e.g. fever, circulating antibodies or the skin)
* tissue specific (e.g. local inflammation, Tissue resident cells e.g. T cells)
* cell intern (intra cellular processes). The oldest form of protection that developed already in prokaryotes.

## Adaption of the Immune System
The entire immune system adapts the way and strength of protection provided at each location in the body. The immune adaption depends both on the personal history of exposure to pathogens and the one, ones the ancestors have been exposed to (genetic adaption)
* lifetime adaption: personal history of exposure to antigens experienced to be harmful. One hand hand more immune cells may relocate or replicate increased in locations where pathogens haven been observed. On the other hand the specific parts of immune systems have mechanism of memorizing seen pathogens ([Variable Immune System](#variable-immune-system))
* generational adaption: personal and ancestral exposures are memorized and cause both the innate and adaptable immune system to adapt

### Redistribution of 


## Immune System Specificity
[in work]
There are many degrees of specificity, the following categories are just a coarse approximation.

* broad e.g.:  
    - skin: keep everything out
    - neutrophil granulocytes: local shutdown of all forms of life
* semi specific e.g.:
    - intracellular processes from eukaryotes targeting single stranded DNA
    - membranes: only permeable for specific substances
* specific:     
    Some of the biological immune mechanisms are specific
    - constant targeting throughout lifetime (can be stored in [lifetime storage])
        * RNA pieces silencing mRNAs / other RNAs [to check whether this can't be adapted, probably unused DNA is used produce some silence RNA so the overall possibilities would be constant but what is in used would be adaptable]
    - variable targeting throughout lifetime: [Trained Immune System](#trained-immune-system)
        
### Trained Immune System
Some parts of the immune system is able to vary is targets throughout lifetime. 
> ###### Allergy
> Sometimes proteins parts not associated to pathogens are classified as being harmful. This yields allergies. 

#### Examples
* Antibodies: bind to specific proteins and thereby inactivate or mark them
* Trained T cells

#### Mechanisms to Produce Different Binding Capabilities
One mechanisms to produce different cells able to bind to different substances is, that the binding parts of these cell are randomized i.e. the genes coding these binding parts are generated by a process which produces random sequences. Now the immune system needs to check that: 
1. these randomized binding sites don't bind to something useful e.g. healthy cells belonging from the same organism (self).
2. these randomized binding sites are useful i.e. they bind to something harmful. 

Checking these conditions is called training. 

##### How Training works
[in work, to be completed and to be checked]
1. In the __bone marrow__ continuously new immune cell arise from stem cells. A certain class of immune cells with different binding capabilities moves to the thymus and these are called Thymus cell (T cells). 
2. In the __thymus__ it is checked if the selected cell bind to self substances:
   * If the cell binds self substances => harmful since the own body is attacked => trigger cell death (if these goes wrong an autoimmune disease can result)
   * If the cell does *not* bind self => The cell is not attack self and thus not harmful => send the cell to the lymph nodes. 
3. In the __lymph nodes__ the cells are exposed to foreign substances. If a cell binds to unknown and harmful substances the cell is useful. 

<!--
3. Unwanted things or things reaching end of life are disassembled (e.g. SARS-Cov-2 infected cells usually die)
4. The decay particles then analyzed by the immune system for filtering out decay particles already known.
  * The decay particles recognized as known (self or known foreign) are not interesting and disposed
  * The unknown particles, are presented to a special class of immune cells, if a cell turns to be capable to bind this new substance, the cell is selected. 
 

> ###### Antigen
 Particles classified as unwanted to which the immune system is able  particles they bind are called *antigens*.

> ###### Antibody
> The elements by which the immune system can bind to antigens are called *antibodies*.

## Cross Immune Protections
All form of life on earth share common molecular patterns. The more genetically related the forms, the more genes and corresponding proteins are similar. Some elements are more conserved and are possible targets to develop cross protections either by the immune system or artificial medications. 

### Cross Protections Observed
*  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012) observed that some serum conversions against one coronaviruses are not followed by serum conversion against another coronavirus as follows:
    - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional, both OC43 and HKU1 are betacoronaviruses)
    - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
* [Han et al](#han) showed that calves innoculated with HECV-4408 get immune protection against the BCoV strain DB2. HECV-4408 is a BCoV strain that has been observed to cause [diarrhea in humans](./coronavirus.md#observed-interspecies-infections).


## How SARS-2 Overcomes Immune Obstacles

### Overcome Physical Barriers
- skin <- circumvented by coronaviruses by entering via breathing
- mucus <- less mucus in the lungs and nasal cavity
- cell membranes <- bind to receptor and fuse membranes with spikes

### Overcome Chemical Barriers
- stomach acid <- circumvented by coronaviruses 
  - replicate to high numbers in the lungs and pass through the very thin alveolar epithel layer to the blood
  - replicate to high numbers in the upper respiratory tract and hope some virion sneak through when drinking (when drinking fluids usually don't rest in the stomach)

### Overcome Biological Barriers
#### Overcome Phagocytosis
Phagocyte <- exploit phagocytosis by infecting the cell
- SARS-2 can replicate in macrophages
- In most immune cells no replication takes place (e.g. T cells) since cell death is induced. But by cell death the immune cell is still knocked out.
 
#### Overcome Antibodies
[in work]
For coronaviruses waiting until antibody based immunity wanes or even jumping generations is often not an option, thus circumventing antibodies is an essential skill. Coronaviruses have a variety of mechanisms to circumvent antibodies. However circumventing antibodies is oft not free for coronaviruses, so antibodies slow down coronaviruses and the immune system has more time.
- Mutations
- Shields
  - glycan shields
  - variable regions on the outside which mutate with high frequency
- Masking
  - sensitive regions e.g. receptor binding domains are shielded until primed
  - different priming steps in different locations in the hosts enabling intrahost spread
- Exploitation
  Exploiting antibody induced phagocytosis

## Appendix

### Biology, Chemistry and Physics
> [in work]
> Historically biology, chemistry and physics evolved as separate scientific disciplines with the tasks:
> - Biology: Observing and describing living organisms.
> - Chemistry: the successor of alchemy (the transmutation of metals from greek al=the and khēmia=transmuting metals). Chemistry is about transmuting and disassembling substances.
> - Physics: Movements and forces on solid objects. Early handed down descriptions and experiments were done by Archimedes and Galileo. Newton mathematically described the observed planetary motions as the movement of objects rotating around the sun subject to gravity. From that point on physics dealt with distance forces influencing the acceleration of objects. This approach turned out to describe many phenomena in nature.
> 
> Concepts from physics (movements of particles, behavior of waves, forces and related concepts) can be used to model/explain nearly every phenomena observed.
> The underlying mechanism of chemical reactions can be explained by the behavior of the outer electron shells of atoms. Mostly these underlying mechanisms can be abstracted away however and chemistry describes how atoms react with each other. Molecular biology in turn is the chemistry of molecules only occurring in the context of life forms. The building block of life can be described by molecular biology. Life forms, which are complex constructs huge numbers of these building blocks, show phenomena that are often best described by abstracting away the building blocks. So physics, chemistry and biology describe different parts of nature.
> 
> Physical, chemical and biological are used here as follows:
> - ##### Physics
>   Physics is about the behavior of particles and bodies and how they interact with each other to change their movements and states. The behavior of particle systems (many particles which interact) is often easier/only doable by considering the entity and not single particles.
> - ###### Chemistry
>   *Chemistry* describes reactions of substances. *Chemical reaction* = changes in the electron arrangement of the outer electron shells.
> - ###### Biology
>   Molecular biology which is essentially the chemistry of life forms: Reactions and participating substances occurring only in the context of [life forms](./coronavirus.md#life-form) on earth. Mostly these are complex organic molecules and their reactions. 'Classical' biology
