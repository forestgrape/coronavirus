# Immune System

[in work and incomplete] Selected topics of the immune protection with a focus protection versus coronaviruses are discussed. 
> The *immune system* denotes organs and processes that keep the body and metabolism free of unwanted things either by preventing entry or getting rid of them. 

Nearly all forms of life have some immune mechanisms. Even viruses encode proteins to stop the host from interferring with their metabolism: E.g. the host immune system tries to stop the virus metabolism and so the the virus immune system in turn tries the stop the host immune system. 

A lot of completely different immune mechanism have evolved in the different forms of life. Immune mechanism can be classified according to various criteria:
- [protection locations](#protection-locations): local or global
- [immune system mechanism](#immune-system-mechanisms): physical, biological or chemical
- [immune system specificity](#immune-system-specificity): 
    Which and how substances and forms of life are recognized and targeted. 


## Protection Locations
Immune responses can be global (affecting the entire body), local for some tissue or even inside single cells:
* entire body (e.g. fever, circulating antibodies or the skin)
* tissue specific (e.g. local inflammation, Tissue resident cells e.g. T cells)
* cell intern (intra cellular processes). The oldest form of protection that developed already in prokaryotes.

## Immune System Mechanisms
[in work and incomplete]
### Physical Mechanisms
The outer layer of a body i.e. the surface of a body - anything that can be reached while the body is not injured - is called epithelial layer and the cells epithelial cells i.e. the cells on the surface. This layer has often various protections e.g. dead cells (which is the case for the skin) or mucus (which is the case in the respiratory tract). So even if a virion reaches a target host there still many obstacles to reach an exploitable tissue:
* acidic fluids (e.g. stomach acid)
* mucus clearance
* protecting layers: dead cells on the epithelium (e.g. skin)

### Chemical Mechanisms
* change of pH

### Biochemical Mechanisms
* antibodies target specific structures of proteins

## Immune System Specificity
[in work]
> There are many possible degrees of specificity, the following categories are just a coarse approximation.

* broad e.g.:  
    - skin: keep everything out
    - neutrophil granulocytes: local shutdown of all forms of life
* semi specific e.g.:
    - intracellular processes from eukaryotes targeting single stranded DNA
    - membranes: only permeable for specific substances
* specific:     
    Some of the biological immune mechanisms are specific
    - constant targeting throughout lifetime (can be stored in [lifetime storage])
        * RNA pieces silencing mRNAs / other RNAs [to check whether this can't be adapted, probably unused DNA is used produce some silence RNA so the overall possibilities would be constant but what is in used would be adaptable]
    - variable targeting throughout lifetime: [variable immune system](#variable-immune-system)
        
    

#### Variable Immune System
A collection of immune cells which can target substances which have been learned to be unwanted, where unwanted can mean: 
- foreign substances
- cells that are considered out of order
- things recognized as being harmful. These are often specific parts of proteins. 

##### Examples
* antibodies: bind to specific proteins and thereby inactivate or mark them
* Trained T cells


### Adaption of the Immune System
The entire immune system adapts the way and strength of protection provided at each location in the body. The immune adaption depends both on the personal history of exposure to pathogens and the one, ones the anchestors have been exposed to (genetic adaption)
* lifetime adaption: personal history of exposure to antigens experienced to be harmful: E.g. antigens similar the Sars-Cov-2 yields cells capable of producing targeted antibodies
* generation adaption: personal and ancestral exposures yields the overall adaption of both the innate and adaptable immune system



## Immune Protections against Coronaviruses
### prevent target reaching
* physical: 
    - skin <- circumvented by coronaviurses by entering via breathing
    - mucus <- less mucus in the lungs and nasal cavity
    - cell membranes <- bind to receptor and fuse membranes with spikes
* chemical:
    - stomach acid <- cirumvented by coronaviruses by going via blood or replicate to high numbers and hope some virion sneek through when drinking (when drinking fluids usually don't rest in the stomach)
* biological:
    - phagocytize 
    - inactivate with antibodies
### Prevent unwanted Metabolisms

#### Self Checks
[in work]
Self checks of the cells: inside the cells there are various systems to keep to cells metabolism immune.

#### Extern Checks
Cells present what they produce on the outside: T cells inspect these substances and can induce aptosis or ring the bells. In fighting coronaviruses T cells play a key role [citations in work].

##### T Cells
T cells are in the blood and locally in tissues. 
T cells play a central role in checking if cells do what they are supposed to do. Virus infected have a changed metabolism and often produce many virions, which can be [detected by T cells](#extern-checks). To control coronaviruses infections T cells are key [citation coming].

> *Tissue resident T cells* or just *local T cells* are T cells which survey the tissues cells integrity. They are located especially at entry points of metabolism changing pathogens which mostly are viruses.

## Cross Immune Protections
All form of life on earth share common molecular patterns. The more genetically related the forms, the more genes and corresponding proteins they share. These [common patterns](#conserved-patterns) are possible targets to develop cross protections either by the immune system or artificial medications. 
 
### Cross Protections Observed
*  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012) observed that some serum conversions against one coronaviruses are not followed by serum conversion against another coronavirus as follows:
    - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional, both OC43 and HKU1 are betacoronaviruses)
    - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
* [Han et al](#han) showed that calves innoculated with HECV-4408 get immune protection against the BCoV strain DB2. HECV-4408 is a BCoV strain that has been observed to cause [diarrhea in humans](#human-bcov-infections).
