[in work and incomplete] Selected topics of the immune protection with a focus protection versus coronaviruses are discussed.

> The *immune system* denotes organs and processes that keep the body and metabolism free of unwanted things either by preventing entry or getting rid of them. 

Nearly all forms of life have some immune mechanisms. Even viruses encode proteins to stop the host from interfering with their metabolism: E.g. the host immune system tries to stop the virus metabolism and so the the virus immune system in turn tries the stop the host immune system.

A lot of completely different immune mechanism have evolved in the different forms of life. Immune mechanism can be classified according to various criteria:
- [Protection Locations](#protection-locations): local or global
- [Immune System Mechanism](#immune-system-mechanisms): physical, biological or chemical
- [Immune System Specificity](#immune-system-specificity): 
    Which and how substances and forms of life are recognized and targeted. 


## Protection Locations
Immune responses can be global (affecting the entire body), local for some tissue or even inside single cells:
* entire body (e.g. fever, circulating antibodies or the skin)
* tissue specific (e.g. local inflammation, Tissue resident cells e.g. T cells)
* cell intern (intra cellular processes). The oldest form of protection that developed already in prokaryotes.


## Immune System Mechanisms

### Prevent Target Reaching
The outer layer of a body i.e. the surface of a body - anything that can be reached while the body is not injured - is called epithelial layer and the cells epithelial cells i.e. the cells on the surface. This layer has often various protections e.g. dead cells (which is the case for the skin) or mucus (which is the case in the respiratory tract). So even if a virion reaches a target host there still many obstacles to reach an exploitable tissue:
* [physical](#physical)
  * mucus clearance
  * protecting layers: dead cells on the epithelium (e.g. skin)
* [chemical](#chemical)
  * change of pH e.g. acidic fluids (e.g. stomach acid) or alkaline environment (e.g. small intestine)
* [biological](#biological)
  * antibodies target specific structures of proteins to inters

#### Example Coronaviruses
* physical: 
    - skin <- circumvented by coronaviruses by entering via breathing
    - mucus <- less mucus in the lungs and nasal cavity
    - cell membranes <- bind to receptor and fuse membranes with spikes
* chemical:
    - stomach acid <- circumvented by coronaviruses 
      - replicate to high numbers in the lungs and pass through the very thin alveolar epithel layer to the blood and reach the intestine
      - replicate to high numbers in the upper respiratory tract and hope some virion sneak through when drinking (when drinking fluids usually don't rest in the stomach)
* biological:
    - phagocyte 
    - inactivate with antibodies

### Prevent unwanted Metabolisms

#### Self-checks
[in work]
Self checks of the cells: inside the cells there are various systems to keep to cells metabolism immune.


#### Extern-checks
Cells present what they produce on the outside: T cells inspect these substances and can induce cell death or ring the bells. In fighting coronaviruses T cells play a key role [citations in work].

##### T Cells
* T cells are in the blood and locally in tissues. 
* T cells can check if cells do what they are supposed to do. Virus infected cells have a changed metabolism e.g. produce virions, which can be [detected by T cells](#extern-checks). 
* To control coronaviruses infections T cells are key [citation coming].

> ###### Local T cell
> *Tissue resident T cells* or just *local T cells* are T cells which survey the tissues cells integrity. They don't travel with the blood they stay locally in the tissue. 

Local T cells are located often at entry points of viruses. E.g. the mouth is a common entry point for viruses, so in the mouth are many local T cells [to check and cite]. 

### Recognize and Eliminate Non-Self
[in work]

## Adaption of the Immune System
The entire immune system adapts the way and strength of protection provided at each location in the body. The immune adaption depends both on the personal history of exposure to pathogens and the one, ones the ancestors have been exposed to (genetic adaption)
* lifetime adaption: personal history of exposure to antigens experienced to be harmful. One hand hand more immune cells may relocate or replicate increased in locations where pathogens haven been observed. On the other hand the specific parts of immune systems have mechanism of memorizing seen pathogens ([Variable Immune System](#variable-immune-system))
* generation adaption: personal and ancestral exposures yields the overall adaption of both the innate and adaptable immune system


## Immune System Specificity
[in work]
There are many degrees of specificity, the following categories are just a coarse approximation.

* broad e.g.:  
    - skin: keep everything out
    - neutrophil granulocytes: local shutdown of all forms of life
* semi specific e.g.:
    - intracellular processes from eukaryotes targeting single stranded DNA
    - membranes: only permeable for specific substances
* specific:     
    Some of the biological immune mechanisms are specific
    - constant targeting throughout lifetime (can be stored in [lifetime storage])
        * RNA pieces silencing mRNAs / other RNAs [to check whether this can't be adapted, probably unused DNA is used produce some silence RNA so the overall possibilities would be constant but what is in used would be adaptable]
    - variable targeting throughout lifetime: [variable immune system](#variable-immune-system)
        
    

#### Variable Immune System
A collection of immune cells which can target substances which have been learned to be unwanted, where unwanted can mean: 
- foreign substances
- cells that are considered out of order
- things classified as being harmful. These are often specific parts of proteins. 

> Sometimes proteins parts not associated to pathogens are classified as being harmful. This yields allergies. 

##### Examples
* Antibodies: bind to specific proteins and thereby inactivate or mark them
* Trained T cells

##### How it works
[in work, to be completed and to be checked]
1. Pathogens at some point yield decay products (e.g. SARS-Cov-2 infected cells usually die). 
2. The decay products then analyzed by the immune system for filtering out decay products already known.
3. Most of the decay products then are recognized as known (either known foreign or self). The unknown substances, are presented to a special class of immune cells, if a cell turns to be capable to bind this new substance, the cell is selected. 
4. It is now checked if the selected cell does *not* bind to self substances. If the cell does not bind self, the cell is capable to specifically produce binding elements to the new substance. 
    > The binding elements are called *antibodies* and the foreign that they bind is called *antigen*.
5. monoclonal replication is induced once more if the new foreign substance are seen.

## Cross Immune Protections
All form of life on earth share common molecular patterns. The more genetically related the forms, the more genes and corresponding proteins they share. These [common patterns](#conserved-patterns) are possible targets to develop cross protections either by the immune system or artificial medications. 
 
### Cross Protections Observed
*  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012) observed that some serum conversions against one coronaviruses are not followed by serum conversion against another coronavirus as follows:
    - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional, both OC43 and HKU1 are betacoronaviruses)
    - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
* [Han et al](#han) showed that calves innoculated with HECV-4408 get immune protection against the BCoV strain DB2. HECV-4408 is a BCoV strain that has been observed to cause [diarrhea in humans](./coronavirus.md#observed-interspecies-infections).

> ### Biology, Chemistry and Physics
> [in work]
> Historically biology, chemistry and physics evolved as separate scientific disciplines with the tasks:
> - Biology: Describing living organisms. 
> - Chemistry: the successor of alchemy (the transmutation of metals from greek al=the and khēmia=transmuting metals). Chemistry is about transmuting and disassembling substances. 
> - Physics: Movements and forces on solid objects. Early experiments were done by Galileo. Newton mathematically described the observed planetary motions as the movement of objects rotating around the sun subject to gravity. From that point on physics dealt with distance forces and this concept turned out to describe many phenomena in nature e.g. phenomena in the context of electricity. 
> 
> Concepts from physics (movements of particles, behavior of waves, forces and related concepts) can be used to model/explain nearly every phenomena observed. 
> The underlying mechanism of chemical reactions can be explained by the behavior of the outer electron shells of atoms. Mostly these underlying mechanisms can be abstracted away however and chemistry describes how atoms react with each other. Molecular biology in turn is the chemistry of molecules only occurring in the context of life forms. The building block of life can be described by molecular biology. Life forms, which are complex constructs huge numbers of these building blocks, show phenomena requiring new concepts for their description and that's a central task of modern biology. So physics, chemistry and biology are all about describing nature but their focus differ. 
> 
> Physical, chemical and biological are used here as follows:
> - ##### physical: 
>   Physics is about particles and their movements and forces that change these movements
> - ###### chemical
>   reactions of substances not requiring life forms and enzymes to occur. 
> - ###### biological
>   reactions and substances occurring *only* in the context of [life forms](./coronavirus.md#life-form) on earth. These are complex organic molecules and their reactions.
