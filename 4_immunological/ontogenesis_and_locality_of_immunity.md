## Conceptual Summary 
The human immune system develops throughout the lifetime and its development is closely interlinked with ageing from birth to death and with pathogens encountered at different entry locations. 
* At young age the recognition of unknown pathogens and learn to handle them is good. This is achieved by strong innate pathogen recognition mechanisms and a fast transport of recognized pathogens to the lymph nodes (e.g. through dendritic cell migration). While the learning mechanisms work well, nearly all pathogens are completely new and so the recognition often relies on innate pathogen recognition mechanisms alone.

* After a few years of life the immune system is already strong since it has encountered many pathogens and learned: Surveillance and protection at frequent pathogen entry locations and a repertoire of mechanism to adequately handle different pathogens. 

* In early adulthood the ability the learn completely new pathogens decreases since the innate recognition mechanism are relaxed. However learning of pathogens similar to existing ones is still strong.

* With increasing age the ability to handle new pathogens diminishes and the immune system more and more relies on a large immune memory built up throughout life. Nevertheless learning to recognize new pathogens still is possible although slower.

* At old to very old age immune cells are subject to senescence. Many cellular pathways don't work as perfectly anymore which causes 
  * constantly some stress to the cells which in turn causes some inflammation. To prevent autoimmunity the inflammation needs to be controlled and therefore the immune system is more relaxed regarding sensing cell stress. This relaxation limits danger recognition by the innate immune system.
  * which can reduce the functionality. E.g. cells taking up and carrying antigens to antibody producing cells migrate slower (dendritic cells take up pathogen part and bring them to the lymph nodes where an interplay between CD4 T cells and B cells induces antibody production). Cells can reach end of life (mostly by apoptosis) whereby some acquired memory is lost.

  Overall the immune system is less performant at this stage.



## Relevance regarding SARS-CoV-2 Infections
At young age the immune system is built to encounter new pathogens and handle them appropriately. It is well known that if one encounters a disease for the first time as adult, the disease is much more severe.

* For infants and children SARS-CoV-2 is just another new virus e.g. like the other endemic human coronaviruses. For coronavirus unexposed people , the current SARS-CoV-2 strains are even less pathogenic than the endemic human coronaviruses since the endemic coronaviruses have adapted the evade the human immune system.

  > SARS-CoV-2 lineages are becoming better at evading innate immune mechanisms but only slowly. I except it will take many years until SARS-CoV-2 comes close to the capabilities of the endemic coronaviruses at avoiding the innate immune system. One reason is, that many parts of coronaviruses are multifunctional, so improving one function often diminishes another function.

* For adolescents and younger adults SARS-CoV-2 is not dangerous neither, since while being a new virus, it is not a completely new virus since SARS-CoV-2 is close to the endemic human coronaviruses. Both innate and cross reactive acquired (mainly tissue resident T cells) immunity recognize the infection. The pool of naive immune cells, which is still large enough and even shaped to recognize coronaviruses, gives rise to a good virus clearing immune response. Usually the acquired immune response is timely enough to prevent the viruses spreading throughout the lungs and thus severe is prevented.

* With increasing age the recognition of new viruses and the capabilities to handle them decreases. Additionally the body in general works slower which delays a timely immune response.



## Key Literature and recommended Readings
* [Lloyd and Marsland](#lloyd) - in a readable review - describe several aspects how the lung immune system developes and highlight the importance of the exposure to microbes.
* [Kumar, Conners and Farber](#kumar) review how:
  * How the immune system is developes at the different locations throughout life (e.g. Figure 3) and is associated with pathogens encountered at the different sites. A focus is the compartmentalization and tissue residency, a topic in which the research group from Mrs. Farber does pioneering work.
  * Differences between the immune system development in mice and human are pointed out: E.g. in human the generation of naive T occurs often locally in tissues where as in mice it occurs mainly in the thymus. Also the lifespan of naive T cells is much longer in human with 5 to 10 year compared to a few weeks in mice.
* [Zheng et al](#zheng) investigate in detail the systemic immune cell landscape in young and old adults: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are analyzed by single cell single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC- seq). Additionally mass cytometry is carried out in a cohort of Covid infectees and RNA sequencing in a cohort of recovered Covid patients (Fig. 1 B).
* [Loske et al](#loske) investigate the cells in the upper respiratory tract regarding immune responses to SARS-2 infections at different ages by single-cell RNA sequencing. A key finding is that the upper airways of children are primed to sense and handle viruses both by cell types and the cell expression profile. 



## Key Observations (Somewhat Technical)

* Innate immune recognition works best at young age:
  * [Loske et al](#loske) find that the genes of the pathogen recognition receptors MDA5 (IFIH1) and RIG-I (DDX58) are expressed at higher levels and at higher percentages of cells across many upper respiratory tract cells in younger people (Fig. 2 b). The usefulness in preventing an infection of these receptors is demonstrated that people with higher expression rates of these PRR have less symptoms (Fig. 2 c).
  * At high age, endoplasmatic reticulum stress is common in many cells and to keep homeostasis the associated danger signals are down regulated, which reduces the chance to detect many positive stranded RNA viruses by ER stress [to confirm and cite].

* At young age the homeostasis is more focussed on infection prevention whereas with increasing age to homeostasis shifts towards dirt cleaning:
  * [Zheng et al](#zheng) observe that the proportion of T cells in blood mononuclear cells is higher for young people than for older (55% versus 40%) whereas the proportion of macrophages increases with age (13% to 22%) // Remark: macrophages can handle viruses to some extent (best with support from acquired immunity). T cells on the other hand are specialized to handle virus infections.
  
  * [Loske et al](#loske) show in Fig 1: In the upper respiratory tract of uninfected adults, few immune cells are present and most cells present are ciliated or structural cells. In children on the other hand even when not infected the cell landscape resembles that during infection with a large number of different immune cells present: Neutrophils, different types of T cells and B cells.

* Initiating an immune response is faster in young age:
    * [Zhao et al](#summary-zhao) observe that dendritic cells migrate slower to the lymph nodes in young old mice compared to young mice.
    * [Loske et al](#loske) find that at young age the cellular communication measured by ligand receptor interactions is increased (Fig. 3 a).

* With increasing age the immune system relies more and more on the acquired immunity built up throughout lifetime. The capabilities to  build up new acquired immunity decrease especially regarding completely new targets:
  * Throughout life the distribution of T cells shifts from naive T cells shift to effector T cells ([Kumar et al](#kumar): Figure 3, [Zheng et al](#zheng): Figure 2 B by RNA seq and 2 C by mass cytometry). The shift is strongest at the mucosal sites such as the intestine and the lungs (Figure 3 in [Kumar](#kumar)).

  * The T cell and B cell receptor diversity is highest at young age. With increasing age the diversity decreases while the receptors have higher degrees of rearrangements ([Zheng et al](#zheng): Text and Figure 5) and are selected by previous pathogen exposure [to confirm and city]. It is to except that the immune response is de novo optimized for SARS-2 in young people, while in older it is strongly influenced by the endemic human coronaviruses - in agreement [Selva et al](#selva) observe that older people more likely have antibodies targeting the S2 domain of S or the nucleocapsid protein which have a higher conservations rate across coronaviruses (to target epitopes in S2 and N has the advantage that these epitopes are less likely to mutate and when they mutate negative effects on the virus viability is more likely than e.g. for S1 domain mutations).

  * With increased age the genes responsible for the adaptive immune responses are up regulated in blood mononuclear immune cells (T-, NK- and B-Cells, Macrophages, Dendritic cells) as shown in [Zheng](#zheng) figure 3 B.



* With increasing age the immune cells become senescent which reduces and alters several functionalities:
  * [Zheng et al](#zheng) observe various changes by looking at differentially expressed transcription factors.

## Development by Immune System Parts
### Innate Immune System
### T Cells
Early in life the majority of T cells are in the naive state. A naive cells able to recognize something useful can induce a memory version of itself. The shift towards predominately memory cells occurs in the first years of life in the intestine and during the first two decades in the lungs.


## Development Stages at different Ages
> work in raw form and incomplete
### Immune System as Infant
#### Learning of the Immune System
* Learn where pathogens and danger enter the body and strengthen the surveillance and protection at these locations [to cite].
* Learn how to learn: The training of the acquired immune system is innate but it can be optimized [to confirm and cite].

#### Protection Provided
* Strong Innate Defense but only partly optimised to entry locations.
* Nearly no acquired immunity. Naive T cell are present throughout the body but no/few memory cells have  are established [to check (theoretically memory cell could be established as foetus since in humans but not in mice T cells are already present) and cite].
* Through the mother milk antibodies and other immune substances support the protection.

### Immune System in Childhood
#### Learning of the Immune System
* Strengthen the immunity for frequent  entry locations and pathogen patterns.
* Train the acquired part of the immune system. Build up a collection of memory T cell and B cell recognizing specific pathogens i.e. build up a library of specific pathogen recognizers.

##### Results
> in work

T cell recruitment works less well in old mice compared to young mice (after MA15 infection). One reason is that the that the dendritic cells migration from the respiratory tract to the draining lymph nodes is impaired (due to increased PGD2 levels). This in turn reduces the recruitment of (MA15-specific) T cells.
