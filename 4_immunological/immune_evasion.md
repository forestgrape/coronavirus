## Overcome Physical Barriers
- skin <- circumvented by human coronaviruses by entering via breathing
- mucus <- less mucus in the lungs and nasal cavity
- cell membranes <- bind to receptor and fuse membranes using the spikes

## Overcome Chemical Barriers
- stomach acid <- circumvented by coronaviruses 
  - replicate to high numbers in the lungs and pass through the thin alveolar single cell epithel layer to the blood
  - replicate to high numbers in the upper respiratory tract and hope some virion sneak through when drinking (when drinking fluids usually don't rest in the stomach)

## Overcome Biological Barriers

### Overcome Phagocytosis
Phagocyte <- exploit phagocytosis by infecting the cell
- SARS-2 can replicate in macrophages (in vitro and in vivo detected by biopsies of severe cases. In vivo likely only macrophages when the local and global immune system is diminished support replication)
- In most immune cells no replication takes place (e.g. T cells) since cell death is induced. But by cell death the immune cell is still knocked out, though usually at the cost of triggering immune system alarms.

### Avoid Being Recognized

#### Change Appearance
Changing the appearance requires the hosts frequently need to learn new targets.
A common way of the changing appearance is mutating.

#### Shield
Most life forms place their core parts in the center shielded from other life forms and the environment. There are different methods to shield:
* [Parts with variable appearance](#change-appearance) e.g. by mutating/recombining often.
* Regions which are hard to recognize: E.g. unpolarized substances such as glycans or fatty acids. 
* Host acquired substances: 
  * The host cell acquired envelope.
  * During the metabolic phase the coronaviruses not only use the hosts ribosomes but also other substance e.g. they rearrange the membranes of the ectoplasmatic reticulum to have a protected space for genome expression and replication [to check and cite].

#### Mask
Functional regions are usually [shielded](#shield) until used: The receptor binding domains are buried within the spike trimers until [primed](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#virion-priming). Different priming steps in different locations can give different appearances at different locations in a host -> enabling intra-host spread [to check/confirm]


### Overcome Acquired Immunity
[in work, citations coming]
For coronaviruses waiting until acquired wanes or even jumping generations is usually not an option, thus circumventing acquired immunity is an essential skill. 

#### Overcoming Neutralizing Antibodies
[in work, to check and cite]
The only virion protein well accessible from the outside is the spike protein, so that's the target. If a sufficient number of spikes have antibodies attached: 
* a virion cannot infect cells on its own anymore, since working spike proteins are needed for active cell entry.
* virions are marked for phagocytosis which often destroys virions.

> ##### Neutralizing Antibodies
> Antibodies that block virions from infecting cells are called neutralizing antibodies. 

Coronaviruses use nearly all the mechanisms to [avoid recognition](#avoid-being-recognized) to circumvent neutralizing antibodies.
- Mutate
  Mutating prevents recognition by [changing appearance](#change-appearance). Mutations are not free though, since most mutations reduce the biological fitness, so neutralizing antibodies slow them down.
- Shield
  [Shields](#shield) often protects key functional parts.
  - glycans on the outside
  - variable regions on the outside which mutate/recombine often
- Mask
  - sensitive regions e.g. receptor binding domains are shielded until [primed](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#virion-priming). 
  - different priming steps in different locations can give a different appearance at different locations in a host -> enabling intra-host spread [to check/confirm]
- Exploit
  Exploiting antibody induced phagocytosis by infecting the [phagocyte cell](#overcome-phagocytosis)
  
> Natural infections and vaccines also produce antibodies targeting no exposed substances, these helps to fight infections: during the intracellular assembling process, the virion proteins can get antibody-marked.

> Besides antibodies, natural infections and most (all?) vaccines induce also specific immune cells such as memory T cells targeting different antigens of viruses. T cells are effective at recognizing infected cells since cells (especially cells in the epithelium) present pieces of the proteins they produce.
