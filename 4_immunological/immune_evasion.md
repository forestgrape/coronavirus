# Coronaviruses Immune Evasion

## Overcome Physical Barriers
- skin <- circumvented by human coronaviruses by entering via breathing
- mucus <- less mucus in the lungs and nasal cavity
- cell membranes <- bind to receptor and fuse membranes using the spikes

## Overcome Chemical Barriers
- stomach acid <- circumvented by coronaviruses 
  - replicate to high numbers in the lungs and pass through the thin alveolar single cell epithel layer to the blood
  - replicate to high numbers in the upper respiratory tract and hope some virion sneak through when drinking (when drinking fluids usually don't rest in the stomach)

## Overcome Biological Barriers
### Overcome Phagocytosis
Phagocyte <- exploit phagocytosis by infecting the cell
- SARS-2 can replicate in macrophages (in vitro; in vivo likely only macrophages when the local and global immune system is diminished will support replication)
- In most immune cells no replication takes place (e.g. T cells) since cell death is induced. But by cell death the immune cell is still knocked out, though usually at the cost of triggering immune system alarms. 

### Overcome Acquired Immunity
[in work, citations coming]
For coronaviruses waiting until acquired wanes or even jumping generations is usually not an option, thus circumventing acquired immunity is an essential skill. 

#### Overcoming Neutralizing Antibodies
[in work, to check and cite]
The only virion protein reliable accessible is the spike protein, so that's the target. If a sufficient number of spikes have antibodies attached a virion cannot infect cells on its own anymore, since working spike proteins are needed for active cell entry. Antibodies that block virions from infecting cells are called neutralizing antibodies. Coronaviruses have a variety of mechanisms to circumvent neutralizing antibodies. But circumventing neutralizing antibodies is not free for coronaviruses, so neutralizing antibodies slows them down, the immune system has more time and neutralizing antibodies also act
- Mutate
- Shield
  - glycans on the outside
  - variable regions on the outside which mutate/recombine often
- Mask
  - sensitive regions e.g. receptor binding domains are shielded until [primed](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#virion-priming). 
  - different priming steps in different locations can give a different appearance at different locations in a host -> enabling intra-host spread [to check/confirm]
- Exploit
  Exploiting antibody induced phagocytosis by infecting the [phagocyte cell](#overcome-phagocytosis)
  
> Neutralizing antibodies act also as non-neutralizing antibodies (cells show what they produce on the outside. An infected cell usually produces coronavirus spikes and this spikes get presented on the cell membrane. Immune cells such as T cells can detect this and induce cell death. So the cell is stopped from producing many virions.

> Besides antibodies, natural infections and to some extent vaccines induce also specific immune cells such as memory T cells targeting different antigens of viruses. These T cells are especially effective at recognizing the presented antigens mentioned above.
