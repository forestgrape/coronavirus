## Summary


"Selected topics of the immune system with a focus on protection versus coronaviruses."

> ###### Immune System
> The *immune system* denotes organs and processes which keep the homeostasis regarding life forms interactions. This is achieved by watching interactions within or between life forms and if necessary adapt or reduce the interactions such that they are advantageous or at least not adverse.

* *The immune system is pragmatic and efficiency focused*:
  * the immune system usually is minimalist and does just as much to prevent harm but no more.
  * often tries to redirect interactions to mutual benefits. 
  
  > Else life forms on todays earth would be busy fighting pathogens.  
  
  > Nearly all life forms on todays earth create and cooperate in a variety of forms, which indicates an evolutionary advantage of these behaviors.
  
* The immune system gives 'immunity' to damage from interactions but usually does not prevent interactions. E.g. regarding pathogen infections the immune system reduce the pathogens just enough they don't do damage but no more or are even beneficial. There are some rare pathogens which nearly always do damage, but the vast majority of live forms interactions are only harmful in specific situations and often life forms find ways to work together for mutual benefit.

> At some point the immune system definition here involved "targeting things recognized to be unwanted", however this definition falls since the immune system usually adapts the interactions. An often given definition is fighting pathogens or even more specific producing antibodies against pathogens. These actions are subsets of the mechanisms of the immune system as defined here.

> Life is all about homeostasis. Provide a good and constant environment for the core parts of a life form to live and replicate regardless whatever the environment is. Homeostasis is a constant and ubiquitous task, also in day to day life: If there's not enough water in the blood we get thirsty, if it's too hot we sweat and if it's too cold some specialized cells warm the body.


Nearly all forms of life have some immune mechanisms. Even viruses encode proteins to reduce the hosts from interfering with their metabolism. It's a two way interaction: The host immune system tries to reduce the virus metabolism and the virus immune system in turn tries the reduce the host immune system. Usually a balance is reached and both life side a side or even in symbiosis.

Immune mechanism can be viewed from different perspectives and accordingly classified to various criteria:
- [Immune System Goals](#immune-system-goals): Prevent entry | eliminate unwanted | supervise metabolism.
- [Immune System Tools](#immune-system-tools): Physical, chemical and biological mechanism are in use.
- [Immune System Specificity](#immune-system-specificity): Which substances are recognized and targeted. Substances that are ignored.
- [Protection Locations](#protection-locations): Local or global. At frequent foreign substances entry points many local protection mechanism are in place.



## Tools of the Immune System

### A Task for each Tool
[in work and incomplete]
As [defined](#immune-system) the immune system task is to keep the metabolism free of unwanted things. The different tools of the immune system have different goals/tasks:
* [Prevent Entry](#prevent-entry)
* [Detect and Eliminate Unwanted Things](#detect-and-eliminate-unwanted-things)
* [Prevent Unwanted Metabolisms](#prevent-unwanted-metabolisms)

#### Prevent Entry
Against many pathogens a physical barrier is the first and most effective line of defence. Where possible this defense mechanism is in place. However where a an exchange of chemical and biological substance is needed no complete physical barrier is possible but other obstacles are in place:
* alveoli in the lung: exchange of oxygen => the respiratory tract evolved such that most particles don't reach the alveoli, described in [Particle Dynamics in the Respiratory Tract](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#particle-dynamics-in-the-respiratory-tract).
* Intestine in the alimentary => To take up nutrients the intestine needs to  be permeable to chemical and biological substance and the substance also need to reach it. To reduce the amount of pathogens reaching the intestine, the acidic stomach is in front of the alkaline intestine.

#### Detect and Eliminate Unwanted Things
Unwanted can mean:
- foreign substances
- cells considered out of order
- things classified as being harmful. These are often specific parts of proteins.

#### Prevent Unwanted Metabolisms
In some cases preventing unwanted metabolism is done by eliminating whole cells, in that case preventing unwanted metabolism yields eliminating unwanted cells and so is a special case of [eliminating unwanted things](#detect-and-eliminate-unwanted-things). But often the immune response is more fine-grained e.g. silencing foreign RNAs.

##### Self Check of the Cells
[in work]
Self checks of the cells: inside the cells there are various systems to keep to cells metabolism immune.
* RNA silencing
* Detect foreign RNA e.g. double stranded
* Detect stress e.g. Ribosome permanently producing. 

##### Extern-checks
Cells present what they produce on the outside: Immune cells (e.g. T cells) inspect these substances and can induce cell death and/or ring the bells.

### How the Tools Work
The mechanisms can be classified by the mode of action either physical, chemical or biological. The relations between Physics, Chemistry and Biology are sketched in [Biology, Chemistry and Physics](#biology-chemistry-and-physics).

#### Physical Mechanisms
* protecting layers: dead cells on the epithelium (e.g. skin)(The outer layer of the body = the surface of the body = anything that can be reached while the body) is not injured - is called epithelial layer and the cells epithelial cells i.e. the cells on the surface. This layer has often various protections e.g. dead cells (which is the case for the skin) 
* mucus clearance:
  * middle and upper respiratory tract
  * many parts of the alimentary tract
* [Immune System Goals](#immune-system-goals): mainly used to prevent entry, sometime to eliminate substances.

#### Chemical Mechanisms
 * change of pH e.g. acidic fluids (e.g. stomach acid) or alkaline environment (e.g. small intestine)
 * degradation of substances by hydrogen peroxide
 * [Immune System Goals](#immune-system-goals): often used to prevent entry (stomach) or eliminate substances.

#### Biological Mechanisms
Recognizing biological substances as unwanted and eliminate them. Unlike chemical and physical mechanisms biological mechanism can specifically recognize substances and thereby distinguish different life forms and even self and non self. 
[Immune System Goals](#immune-system-goals): Often the recognizing part is carried out by biological mechanism which allow specific targeting and the elimination part is then chemical or physical. 







## Assign Tasks to Tools: Immune System Targeting

### Immune System Target Specificity
The range of specificity is large, the following categories are just a coarse approximation.

* #### Unspecific
  Examples  
  - skin: keep everything out
  - some immune cells such as neutrophil granulocytes: local shutdown of all living things
  - stomach acid
* #### Semi Specific
  Examples
  - Receptors from double stranded DNA based lifeforms targeting single stranded DNA
  - Membranes (e.g. Cell membranes, nucleus membrane, blood brain barrier): only permeable for specific substances

* #### Highly Specific  
  Examples
  * RNA pieces silencing other RNAs [to check whether this can't be adapted, probably unused DNA is used produce some silence RNA so the overall possibilities would be constant but what is in used would be adaptable]
  * Antibodies target specific biological substances (mostly proteins). Antibodies are an example of the[Trained Immune System](#trained-immune-system). 



### Target Mechanisms

#### Detecting Protein Structures
> ###### Antigen
 Particles classified as unwanted to which the immune system is able  particles they bind are called *antigens*.

> ###### Antibody
> The elements by which the immune system can bind to antigens are called *antibodies*.

## Protection Locations
Immune responses can be global (affecting the entire body), local for some tissue or even inside single cells:
* entire body (e.g. fever, circulating antibodies or the skin)
* tissue specific (e.g. local inflammation, Tissue resident cells e.g. T cells)
* cell intern (intra cellular processes). The oldest form of protection that developed already in prokaryotes.


## Immune System Members

### T Cells
* T cells are in the blood and locally in tissues. 
* T cells can check if cells do what they are supposed to do. Virus infected cells have a changed metabolism since they produce proteins encoded by the viruses. [T cells can detect](#extern-checks) the virus proteins exposed.
* To control coronaviruses infections T cells are key [citation coming].

> ###### Local T cell
> *Tissue resident T cells* in literature, often shortened to *local T cells* on this page, are T cells which survey the tissues cells integrity. They move within tissues and and do not circulate with the blood. //previously shortened here as *local* T cells

#### Distribution
T cells are in the blood, in lymph nodes and resident T cells in tissues. Lymph nodes and tissue resident T cells are often at entry points for pathogens e.g. the mouth is a common entry point for viruses, so close to the mouth there are many T cells [in work].

##### T Cell Training
[in work, to be completed and to be checked]
1. In the __bone marrow__ new immune cells are produced by somantic recombination. Some differentiation occurs. A certain class of immune cells moves to the thymus. [to check and clarify]
2. In the __thymus__ it is checked if the cells have the right binding capabilities: Binding MHC neither to weak nor to strong. Don't attack self substances. 
   * Fail (wrong MHC binding strength or self substances attacked) => trigger cell death (if goes wrong, an autoimmune disease can result)
   * Succeed (right MHC binding strength If the cell does *not* bind self) => send the cell to the lymph nodes. 
3. In the __lymph nodes__ the cells are exposed to foreign substances. If a cell binds to unknown and harmful substances the cell is useful.


## Adaption and Learning

The entire immune system adapts the way and strength of protection provided at each location in the body. The immune adaption depends both on the personal history of exposure to pathogens and the one, ones the ancestors have been exposed to (genetic adaption)
* lifetime adaption: personal history of exposure to antigens experienced to be harmful. One hand hand more immune cells may relocate or replicate increased in locations where pathogens haven been observed. On the other hand the specific parts of immune systems have mechanism of memorizing seen pathogens ([Variable Immune System](#trained-immune-system))
* generational adaption: personal and ancestral exposures are memorized and cause both the innate and acquired immune system to adapt


### Innate Immune Systems

###### Innate Immune System
> There is no special mechanism to change the targets throughout the life time.

Since targets stay constant, the information is stored in [lifetime storage](../2_biological/life-forms.md#lifetime-storage)).


### Trained Immune System
Some parts of the immune system are able to vary the targets throughout a lifespan of a life form.


#### Examples
* Antibodies: bind to specific proteins and thereby inactivate or mark them
* Trained T cells ([T cell Training](#t-cell-training))

> ###### Allergy
> Sometimes proteins parts not associated to pathogens are classified as being harmful. This yields allergies. 


#### Mechanisms to Produce Different Binding Capabilities
One mechanisms to produce different cells able to bind to different substances is, that the binding parts of these cell are randomized i.e. the genes coding these binding parts are generated by a process which produces random sequences. Now the immune system needs to check that: 
1. these randomized binding sites don't bind to something useful e.g. healthy cells belonging from the same organism (self).
2. these randomized binding sites are useful i.e. they bind to something harmful. 

Checking these conditions is called training (described for T cells in [T Cell Training](#t-cell-training)).


<!--
#### Training Mechanisms

3. Unwanted things or things reaching end of life are disassembled (e.g. SARS-Cov-2 infected cells usually die)
4. The decay particles then analyzed by the immune system for filtering out decay particles already known.
  * The decay particles recognized as known (self or known foreign) are not interesting and disposed
  * The unknown particles, are presented to a special class of immune cells, if a cell turns to be capable to bind this new substance, the cell is selected.

### Redistribution of Immune Cells
[in work]



## Cross Immune Protections
All form of life on earth share common molecular patterns. The more genetically related the forms, the more genes and corresponding proteins are similar. Some elements are more conserved and are possible targets to develop cross protections either by the immune system or artificial medications. 

### Cross Protections Observed
*  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012) observed that some serum conversions against one coronaviruses are not followed by serum conversion against another coronavirus as follows:
    - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional, both OC43 and HKU1 are betacoronaviruses)
    - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
* [Han et al](#han) showed that calves innoculated with HECV-4408 get immune protection against the BCoV strain DB2. HECV-4408 is a BCoV strain that has been observed to cause [diarrhea in humans](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#observed-interspecies-infections).
