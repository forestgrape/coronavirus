## Summary
"Selected topics of the immune system with a focus on the principles."


## Introduction

> ###### Immune System
> The *immune system* denotes organs and processes which watch and regulate life forms interactions such that the interaction are not adverse. 
> * The life form interaction are at the cellular level or below and competitive. 
> * Prevention of damage is achieved by watching interactions within or between life forms and if necessary adapt or reduce the interactions such that the interactions not adverse or even advantageous.

* The immune system can be viewed as part of the homeostasis regulation regarding interactions of life-forms. 

* The life form interaction are of the following forms:
  * The interactions are competitively and if out of balance with negative fitness effects.
  * Only interactions at the molecular and cellular level (as always life is not discrete, so the border is not always clear). Trained neural network interaction are usually considered as not part of the immune system.
    * Worms infecting mammals are fought by stomach acid and antibodies (mainly IgE), so this interaction is part of the immune system.
  * In organisms the immune system includes the interactions between different cells of the organism. Examples:
    * Cancer cells within an organism can be viewed as selfish cells that don't respect the 'rules of an organism', therefore the immune system targets them.
    * If an organism is physically damaged an the cells are out of order, the immune system handles the displaced cells and sends signals to repair the injury.

* *The immune system is pragmatic and efficiency focused*:
  * the immune system usually is minimalist and does just as much to prevent harm but no more.
  * often tries to redirect interactions to mutual benefits. 
  
  > Else life forms on todays earth would be busy fighting pathogens and couldn't spend time on creating. Also interactions are often beneficial to learn and evolve.
  
  > Nearly all life forms on todays earth create and cooperate in a variety of forms, which indicates an evolutionary advantage of these behaviors.
  
* The immune system gives 'immunity' to damage from interactions but usually does not prevent interactions. E.g. regarding pathogen infections the immune system reduce the pathogens just enough they don't do damage but no more or are even beneficial. There are some rare pathogens which nearly always do damage, but the vast majority of live forms interactions are only harmful in specific situations and often life forms find ways to work together for mutual benefit.

> At some point the immune system definition here involved "targeting things recognized to be unwanted", however this definition falls since the immune system usually adapts the interactions. An often given definition is fighting pathogens or even more specific producing antibodies against pathogens. These actions are subsets of the mechanisms of the immune system as defined here.

> Life is all about homeostasis. Provide a good and constant environment for the core parts of a life form to live and replicate regardless whatever the environment is. Homeostasis is a constant and ubiquitous task, also in day to day life: If there's not enough water in the blood we get thirsty, if it's too hot we sweat and if it's too cold some specialized cells warm the body.


Nearly all forms of life have some immune mechanisms. Even viruses encode proteins to reduce the hosts from interfering with their metabolism. It's an interplay: The host immune system tries to reduce the virus metabolism and the virus immune system in turn tries the reduce the host immune system. Usually a balance is reached and both life side a side or even in symbiosis.

Immune mechanism can be viewed from different perspectives and accordingly classified to various criteria:
- [Immune System Methods](#immune-system-methods): Entry Control | Supervise | Recognize and Classify| Fight Class Dangerous
- [Immune System Mechanisms](#immune-system-mechanisms): Physical, chemical and biological mechanism are in use.
- [Immune System Specificity](#immune-system-target-specificity): Which substances are recognized and targeted. Substances that are ignored.
- [Protection Locations](#protection-locations): Local or global. At frequent foreign substances entry points many local protection mechanism are in place.



## Immune System Goals
The goal of homeostasis is to provide optimal conditions for the core parts of a life form. The immune system viewed as part of the overall homeostasis system has the task to prevent damage resulting from life form interactions. The main focus of the immune system is the core part of a life form. Keep the helper parts working is important too since these have functions for homeostasis.

> In multicellular organism the entire homeostasis including the immune system does everything to prevent damage to the core of the organism. Most animals have a hierarchical cell organization: In the case of vertebrates, the best protected cell populations are stem cells, the germ-line cells and the neurons. So the immune system protects these cell populations with a high priority.


## Immune System Surveillance

> **in work and incomplete**


### Entry Controls
Against many pathogens a physical barrier is the first and most effective line of defence. Where possible this defense mechanism is in place. However where a an exchange of chemical and biological substance is needed no complete physical barrier is possible but other obstacles are in place:
* alveoli in the lung: exchange of oxygen => the respiratory tract evolved such that most particles don't reach the alveoli, described in [Particle Dynamics in the Respiratory Tract](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#particle-dynamics-in-the-respiratory-tract).
* Intestine in the alimentary => To take up nutrients the intestine needs to  be permeable to chemical and biological substance and the substance also need to reach it. To reduce the amount of pathogens reaching the intestine, the acidic stomach is in front of the alkaline intestine.


### Inspect the Transport Systems
Both the blood and the lymph are inspected.
* The blood has an army of circulating immune cells and humoral substances (e.g. antibodies).
* In the lymph nodes the body wast is inspected. If there are signs of damage the causal agents are identified and termed as dangerous.


### Supervise the Production of Enzymes
The immune system tightly supervises the production of enzymes. Enzymes are mostly either proteins, a combinations of proteins and RNA and sometimes RNA only.

#### Self Checks of Cells
[in work]
Self checks of the cells:
* RNA sequence inspection and possibly silencing
* Detect foreign RNA e.g. double stranded
* Detect stress e.g. Ribosome permanently producing. 

Upon detection of anomalies, the cells can go into an alert state, ring the bells or even induce apoptosis.

#### Extern Checks of Cells
Cells present what they produce on the outside (via MHC 1 proteins): Immune cells (e.g. T cells) inspect these substances and can induce cell death and/or ring the bells.

#### Prevent Unwanted Metabolism
[in work]
Unwanted can mean:
- cells not considered self
- cells considered out of order
- Specific substances associated to damage. These are often specific parts of proteins.
  
In some cases preventing unwanted metabolism is done by eliminating whole cells, in that case preventing unwanted metabolism yields eliminating unwanted cells. But often the immune response is more fine-grained e.g. silencing foreign RNAs.


## Mechanisms of the Immune System
At a broad level, the immune system can be view to use physical, chemical or biological mechanisms. However the classification as often falls short: e.g. fever = rising the temperature is a physical mechanisms though it effects chemical and biological reactions and fever is accompanied by chemical and biological mechanisms.

> Some notes on the relations between Physics, Chemistry and Biology are in [Biology, Chemistry and Physics](../9_physics/aggregations_of_atoms.md#history-and-relation-of-biology-chemistry-and-physics).

### Physical Mechanisms
Physical mechanisms are mainly used as entry control.
* protecting layers: dead cells on the epithelium (e.g. skin)(The outer layer of the body = the surface of the body = anything that can be reached while the body) is not injured - is called epithelial layer and the cells epithelial cells i.e. the cells on the surface. This layer has often various protections e.g. dead cells (which is the case for the skin) 
* Mucus clearance:
  * middle and upper respiratory tract
  * many parts of the alimentary tract


### Chemical Mechanisms
Chemical mechanisms are often used to disinfect fluids e.g. the stomach content or the content of vacuoles within cells.

Examples of chemical mechanisms in use are:
* change of pH e.g. acidic fluids (e.g. stomach acid) or alkaline environment (e.g. small intestine)
* degradation of substances by hydrogen peroxide


### Biological Mechanisms
Unlike chemical and physical mechanisms, biological mechanism can specifically recognize substances and thereby distinguish different life forms and even self and non self. Often the recognizing part is carried out by biological mechanisms which allow specific target recognition and the elimination part is then chemical or physical. 



## Immune System Targeting
The immune system targeting is mainly based on the locality or feature recognition:
* Target by Locations
  * Stomach acid in the stomach.
  * The respiratory tract has evolved to block most particles except small molecules (02, CO2, H2O) from reaching/leaving the lungs.
* Target by Feature Recognition. 
  * Default Allow = Allow unless Denied: Target everything *with* a specific feature and allow everything else.
  * Default Deny = Deny unless Allowed: Allow only items *with* a specific feature = Target all other items (*without* the specific feature)

  > Default allow is also called blacklist (blacklist = items to block) and default deny whitelist (whitelist = items to allow).

### Feature Recognition Specificity
The range of specificity is large, the following categories are just a coarse approximation.

* #### Unspecific
  Examples  
  - skin: keep everything out
  - some immune cells such as neutrophil granulocytes: local shutdown of all living things
  - stomach acid
* #### Semi Specific
  Examples
  - Receptors from double stranded DNA based lifeforms targeting single stranded DNA
  - Membranes (e.g. Cell membranes, nucleus membrane, blood brain barrier): only permeable for specific substances

* #### Highly Specific  
  Examples
  * RNA pieces silencing other RNAs [to check whether this can't be adapted, probably unused DNA is used produce some silence RNA so the overall possibilities would be constant but what is in used would be adaptable]
  * Antibodies target specific biological substances (mostly proteins). Antibodies are an example of the[Trained Immune System](#trained-immune-system). 



### Feature Recognition Mechanisms

#### Detecting Protein Structures
> ###### Antigen
 Particles classified as unwanted to which the immune system is able  particles they bind are called *antigens*.

> ###### Antibody
> The elements by which the immune system can bind to antigens are called *antibodies*.

## Protection Locations
Immune responses can be global (affecting the entire body), local for some tissue or even inside single cells:
* entire body (e.g. fever, circulating antibodies or the skin)
* tissue specific (e.g. local inflammation, Tissue resident cells e.g. T cells)
* cell intern (intra cellular processes). The oldest form of protection that developed already in prokaryotes.



## Immune System Members

### T Cells
* T cells are in the blood and locally in tissues. 
* T cells can check if cells do what they are supposed to do. Virus infected cells have a changed metabolism since they produce proteins encoded by the viruses. [T cells can detect](#extern-checks) the virus proteins exposed.
* To control coronaviruses infections T cells are key [citation coming].

> ###### Local T cell
> *Tissue resident T cells* in literature, often shortened to *local T cells* on this page, are T cells which survey the tissues cells integrity. They move within tissues and and do not circulate with the blood. //previously shortened here as *local* T cells

#### Distribution
T cells are in the blood, in lymph nodes and resident T cells in tissues. Lymph nodes and tissue resident T cells are often at entry points for pathogens e.g. the mouth is a common entry point for viruses, so close to the mouth there are many T cells [in work].

##### T Cell Training
[in work, to be completed and to be checked]
1. In the __bone marrow__ new immune cells are produced by somantic recombination. Some differentiation occurs. A certain class of immune cells moves to the thymus. [to check and clarify]
2. In the __thymus__ it is checked if the cells have the right binding capabilities: Binding MHC neither to weak nor to strong. Don't attack self substances. 
   * Fail (wrong MHC binding strength or self substances attacked) => trigger cell death (if goes wrong, an autoimmune disease can result)
   * Succeed (right MHC binding strength If the cell does *not* bind self) => send the cell to the lymph nodes. 
3. In the __lymph nodes__ the cells are exposed to foreign substances. If a cell binds to unknown and harmful substances the cell is useful.


## Adaption and Learning

The entire immune system adapts the way and strength of protection provided at each location in the body. The immune adaption depends both on the personal history of exposure to pathogens and the one, ones the ancestors have been exposed to (genetic adaption)
* lifetime adaption: personal history of exposure to antigens experienced to be harmful. One hand hand more immune cells may relocate or replicate increased in locations where pathogens haven been observed. On the other hand the specific parts of immune systems have mechanism of memorizing seen pathogens ([Variable Immune System](#trained-immune-system))
* generational adaption: personal and ancestral exposures are memorized and cause both the innate and acquired immune system to adapt


### Innate Immune Systems

###### Innate Immune System
> There is no special mechanism to change the targets throughout the life time.

Since targets stay constant, the information is stored in [lifetime storage](../2_biological/life-forms.md#lifetime-storage)).


### Trained Immune System
Some parts of the immune system are able to vary the targets throughout a lifespan of a life form.


#### Examples
* Antibodies: bind to specific proteins and thereby inactivate or mark them
* Trained T cells ([T cell Training](#t-cell-training))

> ###### Allergy
> Sometimes proteins parts not associated to pathogens are classified as being harmful. This yields allergies. 


#### Mechanisms to Produce Different Binding Capabilities
One mechanisms to produce different cells able to bind to different substances is, that the binding parts of these cell are randomized i.e. the genes coding these binding parts are generated by a process which produces random sequences. Now the immune system needs to check that: 
1. these randomized binding sites don't bind to something useful e.g. healthy cells belonging from the same organism (self).
2. these randomized binding sites are useful i.e. they bind to something harmful. 

Checking these conditions is called training (described for T cells in [T Cell Training](#t-cell-training)).


<!--
#### Training Mechanisms

3. Unwanted things or things reaching end of life are disassembled (e.g. SARS-Cov-2 infected cells usually die)
4. The decay particles then analyzed by the immune system for filtering out decay particles already known.
  * The decay particles recognized as known (self or known foreign) are not interesting and disposed
  * The unknown particles, are presented to a special class of immune cells, if a cell turns to be capable to bind this new substance, the cell is selected.

### Redistribution of Immune Cells
[in work]



## Cross Immune Protections
All form of life on earth share common molecular patterns. The more genetically related the forms, the more genes and corresponding proteins are similar. Some elements are more conserved and are possible targets to develop cross protections either by the immune system or artificial medications. 

### Cross Protections Observed
*  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012) observed that some serum conversions against one coronaviruses are not followed by serum conversion against another coronavirus as follows:
    - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional, both OC43 and HKU1 are betacoronaviruses)
    - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
* [Han et al](#han) showed that calves innoculated with HECV-4408 get immune protection against the BCoV strain DB2. HECV-4408 is a BCoV strain that has been observed to cause [diarrhea in humans](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#observed-interspecies-infections).
