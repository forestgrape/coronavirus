# Antibodies

> Mainly online for the references. Many of references are relevant for the chapter [Hypothesis on the Tropism of Omicron](../2_biological/omicron.md), where the possible of a changed tropism of the omicron variant and possible ADE effects are discussed.

## Summary
Antibodies are composed of two fragments: 
* Fab (fragment antigen binding) which determines the specific antigens recognized.
* Fc (fragment crystallizable) which determines structural properties, the kinetics and instruction for the immune system. 

Which antibody is produced depends on the immune stimulant and its locations. 

Antibodies have different effector functions to handle antigens:
* _Neutralization:_ Antibodies can render the antigen incapable to function i.e. the antigen is neutralized. Examples:
  * an antibody to the RBD of coronavirus spikes can prevent the spike to bind to its target receptor. Antibodies with such effects are called neutralizing antibodies.
  * Antibodies can neutralized toxic enzymes [to confirm and cite].
 
* _Instructions to the Immune System:_ Antibodies bound to a thing, instruct the immune system how to handle that thing. These instruction are mostly determined how and to which cellular receptors the antibody Fc fragments bind (subclass and glycosylation specific). The instructions can be phagocytosis, cellular cytotoxic effects, which cytokines to produce and complement activation.
  


## Antibody Fragments
Antibodies have two fragments and antigen binding fraction (called Fab for Fraction antigen binding) and immune instruction fraction (called Fc for fraction constant). The genes encoding the Fab are subject to somatic recombination and thereby new Fabs recognizing specific antigens are produced. The genes for the different Fc are constant throughout lifetime.



## Antibody Classification and Immune Instructions
The Fc fragment determines the antibody classification: Antibodies are grouped into classes (IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE) and sometimes additionally into subclasses (e.g. IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 for IgG antibodies). Additionally the Fc fraction can have post-translational modifications such as glycosylation.

### Change the Kinetics
[in work]

### Immune System Instructions
* In the case of IgG, there are the subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. Each subclass in turn can have additional modifications e.g.  glycosylations. These properties determine to receptors the IgG antibody gets attached to.
