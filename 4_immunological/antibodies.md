## Summary
There are different classes of antibodies. The antibody class produced depends on the immune stimulant and its locations. Upon binding with the matching antigen the antibodies trigger effector functions. The effector functions are:
* Antibodies can render the antigen incapable to function/to do damage i.e. the antigen is neutralized. Examples:
  * an antibody to the RBD of coronavirus spikes can prevent the spike to bind to its target receptor. Antibodies with such effects are called neutralizing antibodies.
  * Antibodies can neutralized toxic enzymes [to confirm and cite].
* Antibodies bound to a thing, instruct the immune system how to handle that thing. These instruction are mostly determined how and to which cellular receptors the antibody Fc fragments bind. The instructions can be phagocytosis, cellular cytotoxic effects, which cytokines to produce and complement activation [possibly more to check].
  * In the case of IgG, there are the subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. Each subclass in turn can have additional modifications e.g.  glycosylations. These properties determine to receptors the IgG antibody gets attached to.
