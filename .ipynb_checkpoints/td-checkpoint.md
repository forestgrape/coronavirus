If the primary cause of death in COVID-19 is ARDS with significant pulmonary inflammation resulting in massive cytokine release causing V/Q mismatch manifesting as patchy infiltrates and ground-glass opacities, why then aren't patients being given high dose inhaled steroids? This has been studied in pediatric asthma, and is considered safe and effective. Why are we looking for novel or investigational antivirals when corticosteroids are cheap, safe and known effective reducers of cytokine release?
