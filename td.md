Diarrhoea can be both early (not necessarily a bad sign because it means viruses are cleared down the alimentary and some survived the stomach acid) and later (not so good because viruses went into the blood and infected the intestine; so take special care to the immune system).

Even though I wasn't asymptomatic, diagnosis was not obvious back then. Partly due to lack of respiratory symptoms - not a single cough if I recall correctly - and the supposed low prior probability according to official prevalence and partly because I didn't want to have it and so was satisfied with not experiencing known and obvious symptoms. It first felt strange like a minor food poisoning but no vomiting or the like. Somewhat tired, but that I attributed to a long day before - including sport and a bad sleep in the night. A temperature increase was there: up to 35.5/36.5 from my normal 34.5/35. But since I didn't record the temperature systematically before a, the temperature measurements around 36 degrees were more calming instead of ringing the bells. Symptoms faded away, but a day after an intense sport session, a strange sticky feeling in the chest started - at this point I started seriously considering Covid. Counting everything up it likely was Covid-19 and

(including myself: it wasn't obvious back then, since no fever, no cough etc.

If the primary cause of death in COVID-19 is ARDS with significant pulmonary inflammation resulting in massive cytokine release causing V/Q mismatch manifesting as patchy infiltrates and ground-glass opacities, why then aren't patients being given high dose inhaled steroids? This has been studied in pediatric asthma, and is considered safe and effective. Why are we looking for novel or investigational antivirals when corticosteroids are cheap, safe and known effective reducers of cytokine release?
