## Infection Tropism and Disease Patterns 
**[in work]**

### Abstract Disease Patterns
Coronaviruses can cause infections at different locations and thus induce different diseases: 
* The human endemic coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, NL63 and E229) cause mainly upper respiratory tract infections.
* The coronaviruses directly emerging from zoonoses from wild/outside animals MERS-CoV and Sars-CoV-1 cause lower respiratory tract infections and frequently spread to the intestine. 

In the case of bovine coronaviruses the same strains can cause different infections. These are recognized as different diseases and until the 90's it hasn't even been clear that both are cause by the same coronavirus since they occur often independent:
* enteric diseases (neonatal calf diarrhea, winter dysentery) 
* respiratory diseases (shipping fever and general pneumonia). 

For Sars-CoV-2 too, different infection patterns are observed:  Virulent lower respiratory tract infections, similar to Sars-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV and more subtle upper respiratory tract infections similar to the human endemic coronaviruses. These yields the question how these infection are related and under which circumstance which infection pattern occurs:
* What drives and causes the different infection location patterns?
* How to prevent and treat depending on locations?
* Which are complications and risks?
* What immune protections are raised under which circumstances. 

Regarding these questions the following hypotheses are state and argued:
* Coronavirus can induce distinct infection patterns 
* The infection patterns are the result of and can be predicted by the factors:
    - the virus strain
    - the history of the initial virion[s] i.e. the cell and location they got produced and the physical, chemical and biological factors they have been exposed on their travel
    - the initial infection location
    - the host immune system and its experience with the virus strain
* The pathogenesis, possible complications and the optimal treatment depend on the infection patterns. 


### Infections caused by Human Coronaviruses

##### Abbreviations
- LRI = lower respiratory infection
- URI = upper respiratory infection
- EI = enteric infection

Infection Type| Coronavirus  | Symptoms | Immune_response | possible Complications | Infection Path | Notes
--------------|--------------|----------|---------------|------------------------|---------------|----
URI | NL63, OC43, HKU1, E229, Sars-CoV-2  | Sore throat, upper cough, sneezing | often local T cells (Tissue resident T cells), sometimes antibodies |  LRI, possibly longer lasting infection, local spread | droplet, aerosol | Immune system in the pharynx is used to viruses => milder symptoms and viruses need capabilities to evade/hide. 
LRI | MERS-CoV, Sars-CoV-1, Sars-CoV-2, (NL63), (OC43) | shortness of breath, fever, dry cough | local T cells if available, else antibody response, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, viraemia which can cause death, EI| aerosol, dry form | mainly in dry air since in humid air less likely to reach LR, the lung surface is big so lots of space to spread
EI  | Sars-CoV-1, (Sars-CoV-2), MERS-CoV| diarrhea| local T cell or antibodies | - | through viraemia, through alimentary either by URI or by oral intake| Adequate immune response likely

* The coronaviruses directly emerging from zoonoses from outdoor living animals MERS-CoV and likely  Sars-CoV-1 cause mainly LRI and spread to the intestine. In wild animals this is the [way to spread and survive](#life-cycle-of-a-coronavirus-entity). 
* The coronaviruses well adapted to our 'modern' way of life with dense population and in indoor rooms mainly infect to upper respiratory tract and ignore the intestine. 

> The origin of Sars-CoV-1 is unclear: Related viruses are found in bats and even more similar in civet cats. However seroprevalence of antibodies in civet cats suggest that Sars-CoV-1 is not endemic to civet cats and thus there was a jump to civet cats around the same time (2002) when Sars-CoV-1 jumped to humans. [citations in work]

> The origin of Sars-CoV-2 is unknown. Considering its tropism, animal farming origin with frequent and even persistent infections of farmers seems possible. Goats or sheep could be the hosts of the Sars-2 viruses, possibly even of Sars-like in general. That Sars-CoV-2 was discovered  in a live-animal-market goes in line or a least is no contradiction with a farming origin: Rare severe cases in rural areas may not have rung the bells. However severe lung disease cases connected to a live-animal-market, triggered thorough investigations resulting in the discovery of Sars-CoV-2. That there is a capable virology research facility in Wuhan may

> Virus discovery is not easy and requires the right settings. Some of the settings often need to be guessed since the virus in question are unknown. The human coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63 have been discovered only in 2004/5 despite both being endemic to human for a long time and virologists had the (theoretical) possibilities to discover coronaviruses since the 70's. MERS got discovered in 2012 but likely human infections have occurred long before. [citations in work] [in consideration/thinking]

#### Infection Locations and Immune Responses
[in work and partly **estimated/guessed**, citations coming/in search]

Infection Type  | Location | Symptoms | Immune responses | Comments and Risks/ possible complications/internal  spread  | Infection Path |
----|----|----|----|----|----
URI| Nose (nasal cavity / nasopharynx)| sneezing, loss of smell, headache, red eyes (especially if mask open towards the eyes)  |runny nose (mucus), local T cells or antibodies |  LRI, local spread| aerosol
URI| Mouth (oropharynx) | loss of taste | local T cells|  (LRI), (spread through olfactory route could occur)| droplet, direct contact, (indirect contact)
URI| Throat (laryngopharynx) |sore throat, upper cough | inflammation, local T cells|  LRI| droplet, aerosol
LRI | bronchi | strange feeling in the lungs, shortness of breath, fever, dry cough | antibodies, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, distribution throughout the lungs, (viraemia)| fine aerosol, dry form 
LRI | alveoli | strange feeling in the lungs, shortness of breath, fever, feeling sick | antibodies, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, viraemia which can cause death and spread to many organs| fine aerosol, dry form 



#### Not Infectable Locations
Not infectable since no ACE2 and thus the symptoms from the corresponding location indicate an **agent other** than Sars-2

Infection Type  | Location | Symptoms | Immune response | Comments and Risks/ possible complications | Notes
--------------|--------------|----------|---------------|------------------------|---------------
MRI| Vocal folds | hoarse | - | no ACE2 cells thus no virus replication |
LRI | trachea | cough  | irritation due to virions deposited| [no ACE2 cells](./coronavirus.md#ace2-receptor-distribution) thus no replication| viral load in sputum due to deposition
