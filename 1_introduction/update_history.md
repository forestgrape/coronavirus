## Major Updates
Larger updates here, smaller updates are noted in the section [Minor Updates](#minor-updates) below.

> Note: Not all links work since the page structure has changed.


- 12.5. [Aggregation of Atoms](9_physics/aggregations_of_atoms.md) page to provide context to topics such as condensation & evaporation and efflorescence.
- 23.3. [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment. It reduces the number of infectious virions and optimize the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
- 23.3. Proposal of [Local Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)

- ### Clarifications on Comments and Formulations
  (25.4.21)
  For conciseness all subjective and off topic remarks are formatted as [comment](../index.md#comments). Sometimes this annotating got forgotten: E.g. in the context of Covid symptoms I mentioned transparency is important, but I also meant overall transparency - marked as comment now. 
  A section on the coronavirus page - with the content that Coronaviruses enter and leave cell preferable from the cell side pointing outwards (apical side) - was titled 'Orientation matters' for quite a long time and in the same section I had written McCray & Co instead of McCray et al. Both formulations were because of a 'cool' sound and no ambiguity or hints were intended (accordingly the section was *not* marked as subjective). I acknowledge, that ambiguity was possibly.
    > * The word orientation was used in the sense of positioning  (google-scholar shows quite a few results with 'orientation matters' and most are about physics and also the oxford dictionary lists 'position' as the first meaning).  However, orientation is used in different contexts and depending on the background, what one thinks when reading 'orientation' can vary - in social contexts, orientation is often used to denote attitudes or sexual orientation. 
    > * [McCray & Co](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#mccray) does *not* imply that the research is business focussed (business focussed = showing and interpreting the results to highlight the benefits of a product instead of an unbiased analysis of the topic), it is outstanding and shows a basics principle of betacoronavirus, namely they mostly live on the surfaces and not within tissues.

    > In my opinion, orientations in the sense of attitudes should *only* matter if important for the topic of interest (e.g. sexual orientation usually matters for dating or sport preferences for sport friends).
    
    > For a virus the orientation of a cell is usually not relevant, however it is relevant for coronaviruses infecting the polarized cells in the respiratory tract.

- 1.4. Propelling Spikes: How coronaviruses use their spike proteins as propellors to fly around. Anytime they can move in all directions since their spikes are around the spherical virions. (special note consisting only of this two sentences).
- 18.3. [Virion Viability Page](../2_biological/virion_viability.md) in online work (finally!).
    * Virions decay fast in sunlight, soap and disinfectants (the halflife time is a few minutes).
    * From 0 to 40 degrees the decay is faster at increased temperature and depends on the biochemical environment. In saliva, nasal mucus and sputum the halflife time is about 8 hours at 4 degrees and about 2 hours at a room-temperature of 22 degrees, especially at air humidities around 40%. In dry air or high but not very high humidity the decay is slower.
    * Above 45 degrees the decay fastens (doubling about every 2 degrees) due to the spring-loaded proteins (spikes and sometimes N) loosing their structure and thereby the stored energy.
- 13.2. How Coronaviruses overcome Immune System obstacles moved to separate page [Immune Evasion](../4_immunological/immune_evasion.md).
- 2.2. How [Movement](../3_medical/covid19.md#movement) helps to produce a good immune response and helps recovering from Covid on the [Covid-19 page](../3_medical/covid19.md).


> ### A word of Caution regarding Vaccines 
> (28.1.21, updated 14.2., checked 27.4.)
> What worries me most at the moment is the vaccination rushes and races. It is great and an extraordinary achievement to have vaccines and vaccination programs are well organized. It increases the safety and life quality for people at risk for severe Covid-19. 
> 
> Regarding vaccine recommendations the known and the unknown are important:
> * What has been shown for the approved vaccines is, that they efficiently prevent Covid-19 with typical symptoms combined with positive NPS PCR test and severe Covid-19 at tolerable reactogenicity (typical vaccine side effects).
> * What is mostly unknown/not investigated/not published are adverse effects such as immune system disorders or long-term effects. Especially in view of vaccinating young people, timely investigations/estimates (long-term) and publishing is needed. Both effects are less a concern for inactivated virus vaccines or other protein based vaccines as long as the adjuvants are harmless (which is not always clear e.g. the safety profile of aluminum is surprisingly unclear despite being in use for 90 years.). For other technologies the effects depend on the exact specifications. RNA vaccines are in general __not__ comparable to protein only vaccines (mRNA vaccines do produce proteins but they thereby often [likely always, to check] mess around with the depths of eukaryotic life. This induces a strong immune response with antibodies, stronger than for proteins alone).
> * There are open questions how  SARS-CoV-2 infections are changed apart from reducing typical/severe Covid-19: The effects of vaccines on virus shedding, virus evolution (both point mutations and recombination) and changed pathogenesis are mostly unknown/not investigated/unpublished.
>  
> An unbiased discussion is missing since many risks ignored and unknown risks are dismissed as not possible. 
> In my opinion, for the time being, the vaccines should be used as the evaluations published show clear benefits: For seronegative and PCR negative people at risk for severe Covid. If it turns out, that the benefits outweigh the risks, summer would be a good time to vaccine many/those not at risk. 

#### Comments on a Word of Cautions
>> 3./4./5.12.21: 
>> Originally I was mainly afraid that RNA transfection could mess with RNAi pathways and pieces could be reverse transcribed, which in turn could e.g. cause immune disorders. Also I had some concerns that replication capable cells are transfected, but I abandoned that until late spring (I don't exactly remember why, though I recall some non satisfying searches for resources on the cell tropism and then it possibly just got under in the sea of topics to work on). Back to RNAi: I did some (re)search and dived into RNAi in insects. I considered it as possible to be a concern due to extensive codon optimization in the transfected RNA which is much more than most viruses adapt to the DNA of their hosts (viruses also to some extent adapt at least the GC content of their hosts, however especially RNA viruses have limits to adapt since there is also strong evolutionary pressure for RNA stability and RNA secondary structure.). At some point I thought I am mostly through for insects: Virus derived RNA is communicated among cells (mainly based on the article "Circulating Immune Cells Mediate a Systemic RNAi-Based Adaptive Antiviral Response in Drosophila" by  Tassetto et al). I think at that stage I commented with '[in advanced work]'. However translating from insects to vertebrates turned out to be not straight forward and I struggled with it. One reason was, that back then my knowledge of immunology was limited both for insects and for vertebrates (visible from the state of the immune page back then). Additionally I struggled to fully grasp RNAi and I kinda got overwhelmed by all the "astronauts" and piRNA, miRNA, ... and then it is not that clear under which circumstances RNAi immunity gets triggered in vertebrates and whether the vaccines could activate the possible triggers. I hesitated respectively kept putting off to publish these highly speculative concerns about reverse transcription for a couple of reasons: 1) I once thought there may be the possibility that the vaccines are useful even for not at risk persons so I didn't want to spread out false concerns 2) I didn't want to publish something I mostly guessed but lacked understanding especially not about a sensible topic such as reverse transcription of vaccines, also none of the experts doing great research on RNAi seemed to published concerns. 3) I intended to apply at health authorities (my attitude to vaccines was already critical enough). 4) I even failed to convince my closest to do at least an antibody test before vaccination, nearly all of them. So wanted to found it well, also since many vaccine critics got and gets torn into pieces, so to some extent I also lacked courage. 5) I prefer to put content online when I have the feeling that at least the core ideas are well founded.
Looking back I should have sent my concerns the scientist of the field. Possibly this could have help, possible not since it wasn't exactly secret that there are "mRNA" vaccines campaigns going on, so without good argumentation it possibly would have been ignored. Communication is a point I failed. Looking back I should have sent this page much more around. My main focus was and is to try to make the page useful, additionally I intend to invest in communication.
Anyways, I mostly worked on coronaviruses during these months. The ongoing Covid crises (high death counts and often strict and hard to live with measures) in winter and spring 2021 often seemed more pressing than some hypothetical possibility of reverse transcription and it wasn't even clear if it happens whether it could have adverse effects. From time to time I went back and dived into papers around non structural RNAs and what they do: How the RNA is processed in the cells, how and which immune responses can be triggered, how cells differentiate and the roles of RNA in cellular communication. While I am still unsure about the original concerns about messing up RNAi, these interdisciplinary readings in late spring and early summer 2021 gave rise to the chapter [Vaccine Safety Questions](../10_vaccines/vaccine_safety.md).
>
>> Since RNAi is central for insect immunity and insects can inherit immune information, it could be that there is a conserved pathway of RNAi inheritance in eukaryotes i.e. reverse transcription to germ line cells. RNAi is often triggered by viruses infecting long lived cells e.g. flavivirus (TBEV, zika, yellow fever, ...) infections induce an RNAi response. Therefore RNAi pathways need to have checks so they don't do harm, else these virus infections would be a big problem.
>
>>  To understand coronaviruses what they do and how to tame them, to find a prevention and/or treatment which is known to be safe seemed and is easier than proofing or dis-proofing safety of RNA transfection in my opinion. [Interferons](./../6_prevention_and_treatment/interferon.md) look good.


- 22.12.-23.1. [Diagnosis and Viral Load](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) (before 18.1. on the Covid19 page).
  - Repeated morning saliva and sputum have a reliable viral load which predicts the disease progression.
  - Nose swabs have a detection rate of about 60% and the viral load does not predict disease progression.
  -  Experiences from HongKong (Summary [Wong](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md#summary-wong)) and an investigation from Dubai [Summary Senok](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md#summary-senok).
- 24.11. New Page on [Economics](../economics.md): The proposal is to provide universal capital services (e.g. credits) instead of providing targeted support in different situations/crisis (e.g. the current Covid situation). Goals are:
  - Everyone in need can redesign and reorganize their (economic) life in any situation.
  - Making the economic system more fair in the sense that everyone has the opportunity to choose the economic way of life.
- 1.11. [Strategy](../7_social/controlling.md#strategy) and [On Numbers](../8_data/monitoring.md#on-numbers) sections, where I give my point of view how to tackle Covid and for actions at different incidence levels.
- 28.10. (only summaries available) Early results from [Spread Analyses](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) show that the Covid-19 transmission probability increases with the amount of air exchanged between people. Air exchange is high when indoors (either heated or air-conditioned) and at increased breathing (high altitude, sport, singing). This strongly indicates that [aerosol](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#overview-airborne-transmission) transmission plays a key role. Thus good ventilation, less populated and good and clean mask help indoors and being outdoors with some distance is safe.
    > During the summer droplet transmission seemed most important, because of Covid-19 waves in regions where the sun was high combined with some research indicating that aerosol transmission is rare in humid and warm settings. Steep increase in Europa as climate cooled in October 2020 combined with extensive droplet preventions in place questioned the dominance of droplet transmission. Reconsideration and a detailed look show: The Covid waves, when the sun is high, occurred/occur either in hot areas and are well explained by air-conditioning or by high altitude:
    * Air-conditioning: Brazil, Middle East and Southern US (in California noteworthy is the difference between hot Los Angeles and temperate San Francisco)
    * High altitudes which means cold nights and increased breathing: La Paz in Bolivia, Quito in Ecuador and Bogota in Columbia or at high altitude combined with heat: Mexico City and currently (28.10.) in Kenya.
- 25.10. New page [Spread Analyses](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) in work: Observations and analysis how Covid-19 spreads in different settings.
- 5.10./6.10. moved from literal single-page (all content in index.md) to multiple pages. Pages including short description are in the in the [content](#content).
  > Even though I liked the single page version since it acknowledges the connections, multi-page is simpler to read & manage and helps to make the topics as self-contained as possible.
- 21.9. new section [Backtracing Sars-CoV-1/2](../2_biological/hosts_of_nidovirales.md#backtracing-sars-cov-12)
- 30.7. Updates and corrections across the page in work/in the process of writing down:
	* I wrongly ignored upper respiratory infections for a long time (because most hospitalized/severe cases were/are in the lungs) -> [Disease patterns](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md)
	* In the first months Sars-CoV-2 didn't have the ability to spread well in humid climate. This has changed: the currently circulating strains spread well in humid climate too.
- 27.7. [Disease pattering](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md)
- 29.4/3.5. Reordering of content and new Sections 'Coronaviruses with a Focus on Sars-CoV-2' and 'Immune Protection with a Focus on Coronaviruses' 
- 17.4.20 00:04 GMT  New section online: Evidence for Increased [Immune Protection against Sars-CoV-2 from Exposure to BCoVs](../5_epidemiological/covid_and_bovine_farming.md)
- 4.4.20 Added Section Ideas to Explore
    - starting with [Early On Ventilators](../6_prevention_and_treatment/increasing_the_mucus_flow.md): Increase the mucus flow and clearance by humidified air early on,  to decrease the risk for developing ARDS.
- 25-30.3/9.4.20:  Corrected and looked up aerosol/particulate inhalation which yields to the new section [Particles in the Respiratory Tract](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md##particle-dynamics-in-the-respiratory-tract).
    In the first version, I had written that aerosols don't enter the lungs. False. Aerosols DO enter the lungs. The train of thought yielding this mistake: Entering the lungs is halfway entering the body. So there must have been enough evolutionary pressure to prevent this. This is ~~double~~ triple wrong:
    1. The evolutionary roots of the lungs are the alimentary system (some dozens millions of generations ago), so substances coming in were just cleared down. Even as the lungs and the alimentary separated this process stayed. As we often do too, evolution usually gradually bends things right, rather than rebuilding from scratch.
    2. The lungs developed before we were upright (just a couple of hundred thousand generations ago) and in the original case the clearance of aerosols is earlier and better; shown for mice in [Kleinstreuer](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#kleinstreuer-2018). Ciliate based movement works even uphill, as ski tourers know. But there are limits. A gradual adaption evolved first, the oscillation frequency of the cilia increased, but wasn't yet enough so a workaround evolved:  smallest particulates are cleared by macrophages [citation to be added].
    3. Upright clearance evolved when we all were in warm and mostly humid parts of Africa (well it likely got a little drier in the winter months and savanna replaced rainforest in East Africa, so we had motivation to stand up more and more). In such humid environments, clearance works better. In evolutionary dimensions, there has been only a short time for the adaption to cold and dry climate (how much depends on the overall drive for adaption, which isn't straight forward to say since migration routes have twists, crossings and turns, desert nights tend to be cold around the world and lifestyles were and are different). To a permanent stay in heated indoor spaces, there has been and no genetic adaption at all.

- 6.11. Renamed ~~"Monitor Failure"~~ to [Estimates Out of Bounds](../8_data/monitoring.md#validate-estimates). Case numbers are case numbers and not estimates.
    > Mainly I was shocked by the very steep increase of deaths and still am [analyses in work]. Even though I spent/d a lot of time learning to analyse.
- 5./6.11. Updates in [Spread Analyses](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) in online work:
    * Evidence for super-spreader events at large scale sporting events with spectators. Evidence: 1) players are more frequently infected in regions with spectators and 2) there seem to be increased infection rates in the stadiums catchment areas.
      > Not proven yet but evidence strong enough that risk regions should **stop allowing large scale events** even with protection measures. As of 4./5.11. there still seem to be football matches with many thousand spectators.
    * Sections about observed spreading events in food production factories and airplanes.
- 31.10. [Detect Monitor Out of Bounds](../monitor_and_control.md#detect-monitor-out-of-bounds) in the extended section [Monitor Prevalence](../8_data/monitoring.md#monitor-prevalence) describes how to check estimates in the past: The current death rate multiplied by 400 (inverse fatality) should be about the case estimated a few weeks ago.
