## Covid-19 and Virus Infections
For risk groups, Covid-19 can be serious short-term and such serious infections can damage organs. For people with a good immune system and without risk factors the severity of Covid-19 ranges usually from asymptomatic to moderate illness. For a healthy recovery it is important to have a healthy lifestyle with moderate and situation adapted [movement](../6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md). A healthy lifestyle reliably helps to prevent longer lasting tiredness (long-covid) or immune system overreactions. 

*Awareness* for viruses and *knowledge* what they do and how they can harm or help is important. No reason to be afraid or panic however, unlike viruses we've got a mind, better communication and a superb body police called immune system. The immune system is crucial since avoiding viruses is _not_ possible. Many viruses live temporarily or permanently in our body and form the our virome and some literally became part of our DNA. Viruses can be harmful, but mostly the immune system controls and if necessary limits the virus interactions. Viruses helped us evolving and still can do so.

> Regarding effects: short-term and long-term, adverse and beneficial, unwanted and wanted effects are known and even proven for many things and behaviors, so its about setting priorities. Ideally we all - if we want - are capable to take own educated decisions on priorities or at least can contributing to decisions. 

> Trying to contribute to knowledge and explain knowledge on coronaviruses is a major motivation for this page.

Time to act mindfully, carefully and circumspectly & work together in an open, fair and honest way. 


## Sars-CoV-2 Transmission 
SARS-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted through the air, either by droplets (virions in water droplets flying like balls) or by aerosol (tiny droplets or dust like particulates with virions that move with the air). For Covid-19 aerosol transmission is more frequent and much more dangerous.

Covid transmission paths and prevention:

* __Droplet Transmission__: Water droplets larger than fly in trajectories similar to balls thrown. How fare they fly depends on the initial movement: when coughing or sneezing they fly farther than when talking. Transmission risk is in situation when bad breath/reek of alcohol is smelled. Droplet can be exchanged when close range face-to-face talking and this gives a transmission opportunity. Prevent
    - Masks
    - Distance
    - Side-a-side instead of face-to-face
    - Plexiglas
* __Aerosols Transmission__: Aerosols behave soot/dust-like. Aerosol transmission occurs mainly in heated indoor rooms: the cooler outdoors, the drier in heated indoor rooms and the likelier aerosol transmission. Aerosol transmission is hard to completely prevent, but it can be efficiently reduced:
    - being outdoors and when indoors: ventilation, distance and less people
    - masks, preferably with a good fit and [filter](../6_prevention_and_treatment/masks.md#mask-types) and changed/cleaned frequently.
    - if possibly infected (e.g. having any kind of respiratory symptoms) staying home and *out* of foreign indoor rooms 

    The smoke-model makes it easier to detect and avoid situations with aerosol transmission: Just smelling smoke is the theoretical possibility of infection. Being that exposed to smoke that the cloth start smelling, likely corresponds to a probability of a few percentages to get infected. A neighbors candle won't be smelled through doors, but in a place with an indoor barbecue, smoke is smelled in the stairways. For Covid-19 this means: A single neighbor being infected is no risk, but in place with possibly many infected people e.g. a hospital treating Covid-19 patients, wearing a mask in _all_ rooms is important. Also it is important to ventilate regularly especially before opening doors.

A more in depth description is in the section [Airborne Transmission](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#overview-airborne-transmission)


## How to Reduce Covid-19 Transmissions

> Remark: Some of the following advices are meant when Sars-Cov-2 ARDS/SARS disease patterns peak (which is usually associated to setting with dry air e.g. indoor heated or air-conditioned).

In brief: Think aerosol transmission as smoke like. To reduce the infection possibilities keep some distance or wear a mask, prefer fresh air and think ahead. 

* ### Outdoors
    [outdoors with some distance is safe](../7_social/controlling.md#outdoors-is-safer). Ideally, walk or cycle directly from home. outdoors is unconfined settings, face-to-face talking poses an transmission risk. In heated and few ventilated regions, beware the corridor and stairwell, don't stay too long or wear a mask. 

* ### Ventilate
    [Ventilation](../7_social/controlling.md#ventilation) has been shown to be effective to reduce airborne virus spread. 
    * Open the windows. In cold climates: ventilate the rooms regularly by opening all windows for 5 minutes.  
    * If possibly infected, ventilate before opening the door of your room or flat. 

* ### No Dry Air
    Dry air increases the transmission of coronaviruses since:
    * In dry air, both dust and particles with viruses stay longer in the air.
    * Viruses survive better in dry air.
    * Dry air increases the chance that a virus infection starts in the lungs, where it is more likely to cause a symptomatic or even severe disease.
    * Dry air reduces the defences of the respiratory tract against pathogens.
    
    In areas with indoor heating, drying the frequently washed cloths inside keeps the air humid. If the outside air is warm and dry the windows should be open always. If the air outside is humid and warm air-conditioning should not be used.

* ### Masks
    Wear a [mask](../7_social/controlling.md#masks) in indoor places where susceptible or infectious people are. The longer one stays, the more people there are and the less ventilation there is, the more important. This because the infection risk increases with the amount of indoor air breathed.

    The mask should have a good fit and a good filter. In some situation high-filtration is especially important: in hospitals and if one is possible infected. But if symptomatic staying home or at least at of crowds is crucial, since masks just reduce the spread but do not prevent it. The same is true for all other prevention measures such as distancing and hygiene, they reduce but do not prevent spread. 
    
    Especially to protect others, masks should be switched frequently (e.g. each 2 hours). However coronaviruses are not stable and after two days waiting, putting into the sunlight or washed with soap/warm water nearly all [viruses are decayed](../2_biological/virion_viability.md)). So masks can be reused if [cleaned](../6_prevention_and_treatment/masks.md#mask-reuse-and-cleaning). From time to time it should replaced or washed thoroughly - there's more than Sars-CoV-2, that's not to forget!

* ### Distancing
    Distancing reduces infection risk.

* ### Hygiene
    Keep proper hygiene. Especially wash hands before eating and after toilet. Soap cleans most pathogens and usually destroys enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses or influenza. Hygiene is important because many pathogens are transmitted through fomites. Pathogens can cause tissue damage and/or weaken the immune system. E.g. common cold viruses attempt to weaken the immune system [[kikkert](../4_immunological/immune_evasion.md#kikkert)] and therefore can induce an increased infection risk. Additionally many infections can burden and even if not it is hard to distinguish them from mild SARS-2 infections.

    But do NOT rely on hygiene alone, since the majority of severe Covid [transmissions occur through air](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md).


## Observing - helps to Detect Infections
Notify the well being and possible disease symptoms. Writing down and measuring support diagnosis.
The more common Covid-19 in a region is, the more likely it is, that an observed infection is Covid-19 and not flu/common cold. 

> In my case - South East Switzerland, a day hike away from northern Italy - Covid-19 is/was (as of March 2020) the most prevalent disease.

* Sars-CoV-2 can infect most locations in the respiratory tract except the vocal folds and the trachea. So all respiratory symptoms except a hoarse voice can indicate a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
* The precaution measures against Covid-19 protect against all respiratory diseases, so all respiratory diseases are reduced. Common colds are not common right now. So respiratory symptoms means being careful and even can mean figuring out all the people one could have infected and informing them to watch for symptoms.
* Every morning first smell and then taste your favorite breakfast drink.  
* Measure the temperature several times every day and best in the same situations and record the values. An increased temperature can be an early sign of a possible Sars-CoV-2 infection. However many people have only a slight increase, which doesn't "meet the definition of fever", see [Covid-19 symptoms](../3_medical/covid19.md#symptoms).
Keep in mind that the temperature varies during a day and with the activities performed. That's why several measurements.

    > It's time [for medicine] to move on from digitalization schemes to a continuous color-space and individuality. There's no hard border for fever at 37.5 or at 38 degrees.


## Estimate and Adaptive Planning
While we often prefer straight plans, adaptive planning can be needed in Covid times. Like a game plan where one starts with a plan but needs to adapt depending on the moves of the adversary players. Viruses behave like adversary players and unpredictability/randomness is involved. One reason is that virions don't move on their own and so their movement is mostly random. Nevertheless probabilities can be estimated. E.g. a few days before visiting the grand grand parents, going out late every evening in densely populated pubs is not the best idea. However even if all precautions are taken, there is some probability that one falls sick before the visit, in this case the right step is possibly to withdraw from social gatherings.

> For larger communities (above a few thousand people) planning works better since there is less randomness than for individuals.

Increased infection probability:
* *Increased Exposure to Viruses:* Being in a densely populated and poorly ventilated indoor spaces.
* *Increased Susceptibility to Viruses:* Diminished immune system (long party nights) and increased inhalation of air (e.g. sports, high altitude)

Keeping benefits and risks in mind:
* Whether, when and what to do and care about
* Whether to take additional carefulness otherwhere. E.g. in the Tour the France 2020 not a single cyclist has caught Covid-19 [to confirm] despite excessive sports diminishes the immune system. Likely they were able to reduce exposure to viruses by being careful and a good overall organization.

## Respect and Take Care 
> *We all should be able to live the life we want, as long that's respecting the rest of the world doing so too.* That needs compromises. Every day compromises are searched, negotiated, found and enabled - thanks to everybody! We live in groups with complex interactions, so *we* stands for groups of friends, families, communities, societies, countries and even us all. 

Respecting others to handle and view Covid differently yields an approach with base protections: enabling people to avoid it, but not narrowing others much. 

* Precautions/Protection measures in place in public spaces which everybody needs to use. 
* In *non* general public settings respecting everybody to take/resume/go on with the lifestyle preferred - a considerate lifestyle of course. Depending on the epidemiological situation protections measures can be community/local decisions. E.g. universities provide both on campus and off campus studying.

Note: In cold seasons, overall cases need to be kept lower, since self protection is more difficult due to aerosol transmission (e.g. good fit high filtration masks) and severe Covid is much more likely in indoor dry air (heated or air-conditioned).

> ### Communities and Societies
> Many tasks and challenges are solved best or can only be solved by groups. Even small groups often need some organization, guiding and rules to work. For large groups such as societies these points are even more important. The better group members understand each other, understand the task and work together, the more liberal the settings and relaxed the rules can be.

Controlling SARS-CoV-2 is an individual, a local and global task. The better everybody helps to control it, the lesser the negative effects and the fewer rules and restrictions need to be put into place. 

* Staying out of crowds and taking care even with mild respiratory disease symptoms, a runny nose is enough reason to stay home. E.g. home office/school (e.g. reading)
  > much of the knowledge for this page I acquired by reading. Thanks to everybody making knowledge and articles available!
* Giving infections time to cure. It is known for various virus infections that they can become persistent.
* Respecting everybody who wants or needs (either directly since in risk group or indirectly since direct/indirect contact to persons who need/want to protect) to protect to do so. Long-term effects seem to be rare but experiences are still limited. Keeping cases low is good for everybody and the more people help doing so the better.
* Transport: Ventilation, masks and distance if possible (in that order) are important in public transport. Considering, that many people, especially children, will and should go outside right where they live, limited use of cars in cities is polite - it's nicer and safer with light traffic. // written during shutdown in Spring 2020
* Some slowdown of life: E.g. no party weeks, going home at time. For all including the young, a good immune system in place is crucial, which detects infections early, induces symptoms and clears them. 


## Live Healthily
A good immune system goes hand in hand with a healthy lifestyle.
* Sleep enough, eat healthily, relax and do some sport. 

and avoid weakening the immune system:
* Avoid excessive caffeine, excessive sport (if in a very high risk region), excessive alcohol ...
* avoid being cold or even freezing for a longer period. For this reason, in cold climates, windows shouldn't be kept open permanently. 
* avoid immunosuppressants unless necessary for medical reasons. Immunosuppressants are not a major risk factor for Covid though so no reason to be afraid if they are necessary for medical reasons. 
* try reducing stress for yourself and others. Trying too hard won't help though. 
    
Stress is an important factor, who hasn't experienced falling sick after a stressful period? It's about balancing the different kinds of risks and chances we have been and are facing through our entire evolution.
