# Illustrative, Insightful, especially Helpful and Extraordinary Literature

#### Introduction
This page is a subjective collection of literature which provides insights to understand coronaviruses and their diseases and/or is extraordinary and investigates topics few others do. 
Subjective highlights of the papers are given.

## Jia 2005
H Jia, et al **ACE2 Receptor Expression and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection Depend on Differentiation of Human Airway Epithelia**  <https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.79.23.14614-14621.2005> 
* [Summary and full citation](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#summary-jia-2005) on the coronavirus page.
* This paper is a key foundation of the chapter [Tropism of Coronaviruses](../2_biological/coronavirus.md#tropism-of-coronaviruses)
#### Highlights
* The ACE2 receptor is expressed on ciliated epithelial cells. This differentiation is dynamic and is lost when submerged.
* According to the ACE2 expression, Sars-Cov-1 infects mainly well differentiated ciliated airway epithelia cells. // Differentiated cells in the airways have a fast renewal time which makes longer lasting adverse effects or even permanent damage very unlikely (except for severe cases and/or when the immune system fails other cells can get infected)
* Sars-Cov-1 virions are mainly released on the apical cell side. //So the SARS lives on the surface of respiratory tract and not within tissues. 


## Yan 2018
Jing Yan, et al **Aerosol shedding of infectious influenza virus**  <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1716561115>
[Summary and Reference](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#summary-yan-2018) on the transmission page.
#### Highlights
* "Our observations suggest that influenza infection in the upper and lower airways are compartmentalized and independent."
  * Nasal swabs are not very predictive for aerosol shedding.
  * Lower respiratory tract symptoms tend to indicate higher RNA shedding via aerosol.
* Symptomatic patients infected with influenza A, have about the same nasal viral load as unvaccinated but the vaccinated shed several times more viral RNA with fine aerosol than unvaccinated.

> Similar investigations (more than one and with different strains!) would be very helpful for Covid. //Vaccines companies should better do this than testing vaccines on children.
> * To better understand viral shedding and transmission.
> * Whether to motivate healthy and young to get vaccinated.


## Bertram 2012
Bertram S, et al. (2012) **Influenza and SARS-Coronavirus Activating Proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT Are Expressed at Multiple Sites in Human Respiratory and Gastrointestinal Tracts.** <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035876>
* [Full Reference](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md#summary-bertram-2012) on the disease pattern page.
* This is a key reference for the page coronavirus disease pattering where evidence for a similar compartmentalization for coronavirus infections is shown.
#### Highlights
The paper describes and compares infectable locations for the SARS coronavirus and influenza. It shows the distribution of the  entry receptors (influenza: 2,6-linked sialic acids and SARS: ACE2) and the required proteases (influenza: HAT, TMPRSS2 and SARS: TMPRSS2).
