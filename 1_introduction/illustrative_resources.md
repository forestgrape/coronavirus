## Notes on Reading
A subjective collection of literature which provides insights to understand coronaviruses and their diseases.
* "Highlighted" is a subjective picking of topics discussed in the paper.

## Respiratory Viruses

### Jia 2005
H Jia, et al **ACE2 Receptor Expression and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection Depend on Differentiation of Human Airway Epithelia**  
<https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.79.23.14614-14621.2005>

#### Highlighted
* The ACE2 receptor is expressed on ciliated epithelial cells. This differentiation is dynamic and is lost when submerged.
* According to the ACE2 expression, Sars-Cov-1 infects mainly well differentiated ciliated airway epithelia cells. // Differentiated cells in the airways have a fast renewal time which makes longer lasting adverse effects or even permanent damage very unlikely (except for severe cases and/or when the immune system fails other cells can get infected)
* Sars-Cov-1 virions are mainly released on the apical cell side. //So the SARS lives on the surface of respiratory tract and not within tissues.

### Bertram 2012
Bertram S, et al. (2012) **Influenza and SARS-Coronavirus Activating Proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT Are Expressed at Multiple Sites in Human Respiratory and Gastrointestinal Tracts.** <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035876>

#### Highlighted
The paper describes and compares infectable locations for the SARS coronavirus and influenza. It shows the distribution of the  entry receptors (influenza: 2,6-linked sialic acids and SARS: ACE2) and the required proteases (influenza: HAT, TMPRSS2 and SARS: TMPRSS2).

#### Usage Here
[Referenced](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md#summary-bertram-2012) in the chapter [Disease Pattering](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) which relies on the possible infection locations of SARS-like.

## Transmission

### Aerosol-FAQ
**FAQs on Protecting Yourself from COVID-19 Aerosol Transmission**
<https://tinyurl.com/FAQ-aerosols> Version: 1.87, 9-Dec-2020

* A illustrative and readable description of aerosol transmission.
* Practical measures and tips how to protect from aerosol transmission.
* Written by renowned aerosol experts to inform and design protection measures in the US.

#### Usage Here
Similar tips are in the chapter [Suggestions and Tips](../1_introduction/suggestions.md) and in the [spread assumptions](../7_social/controlling.md#spread-assumptions) on the controlling page.


### Yan 2018
Jing Yan, et al **Aerosol shedding of infectious influenza virus**  
<https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1716561115>

#### Highlighted
* "Our observations suggest that influenza infection in the upper and lower airways are compartmentalized and independent."
  * Nasal swabs are not a good predicator for aerosol shedding.
  * Lower respiratory tract symptoms tend to indicate higher RNA shedding via aerosol.
* Intriguingly symptomatic patients infected with influenza A, have about the same nasal viral load as unvaccinated but the vaccinated shed several times more viral RNA with fine aerosol than unvaccinated. On the other hand for influenza B nasal viral load and the shedding are not much different between vaccinated and unvaccinated.

  > Similar investigations (more than one and with different strains!) would be very helpful for Covid.
  > * To better understand viral shedding and transmission.
  > * Whether to motivate healthy and young to get vaccinated i.e. whether and how aerosol shedding is reduced in vaccinated people.

#### Usage Here
* The chapter [Disease Pattering](../3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) hypotheses the same for compartmentalization for coronavirus infections.
* A [Summary and Reference](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#summary-yan-2018) on the [transmission page](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md).


### Boast 2020-2021
Boast A, Munro A, Goldstein H. **An evidence summary of Paediatric COVID-19 literature, Don't Forget the Bubbles, 2020.** 
<https://doi.org/10.31440/DFTB.24063>
#### Highlighted
* An overview of the Covid spread in schools and children which has rolling updates.
* Concise summaries of many investigations of the spread in schools.
* Children are less infectious than adults and no super spreading is observed for children
  * adults in school settings yield more secondary cases than children (despite children tend to have closer contact)
  * hardly any clusters among pupils are observed

#### Usage Here
Not yet, but will be included to [Spread Analyses of Children and Schools](../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#schools-and-children)
