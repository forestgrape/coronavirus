# Coronaviruses Immune Evasion

### Overcome Physical Barriers
- skin <- circumvented by human coronaviruses by entering via breathing
- mucus <- less mucus in the lungs and nasal cavity
- cell membranes <- bind to receptor and fuse membranes with spikes

### Overcome Chemical Barriers
- stomach acid <- circumvented by coronaviruses 
  - replicate to high numbers in the lungs and pass through the thin alveolar single cell epithel layer to the blood
  - replicate to high numbers in the upper respiratory tract and hope some virion sneak through when drinking (when drinking fluids usually don't rest in the stomach)

## Overcome Biological Barriers
### Overcome Phagocytosis
Phagocyte <- exploit phagocytosis by infecting the cell
- SARS-2 can replicate in macrophages
- In most immune cells no replication takes place (e.g. T cells) since cell death is induced. But by cell death the immune cell is still knocked out, though usually at the cost of triggering immune system alarms. 

### Overcome Acquired Immunity
[in work, citations coming]
For coronaviruses waiting until acquired wanes or even jumping generations is usually not an option, thus circumventing acquired immunity is an essential skill. 

#### Overcoming Neutralizing Antibodies
[in work, to check and to add refs]
The only protein well accessible for coronavirus virions is the spike protein, so that's the target. If a sufficient number of spikes have antibodies attached a virion cannot infect cells on its own anymore, since working spike proteins are needed. Antibodies that block virions from infecting cells are called neutralizing antibodies. Coronaviruses have a variety of mechanisms to circumvent neutralizing antibodies. However circumventing neutralizing antibodies is not free for coronaviruses, so neutralizing antibodies slow down them and the immune system has more time. Additionally neu
- Mutate
- Shield
  - glycans on the outside
  - variable regions on the outside which mutate/recombine often
- Mask
  - sensitive regions e.g. receptor binding domains are shielded until [primed]
  - different priming steps in different locations in the hosts enabling intra-host spread
- Exploit
