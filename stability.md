## Introduction
[Virions](./coronavirus.md#virion) aren't very stable compared to other forms of live. The principal reasons for the instability of virion are:
* The genome is [stored in unstable ssRNA](./coronavirus.md#ssrna)
* The envelope of coronaviruses consists of fatty acids which form the cell membranes of the virus host organism. In multicellular organism the cell membranes have not evolved to be stable outside the organism.
* Virions have no repair mechanism since they don't have a metabolism

[Virions](./coronavirus.md#virion) decay happens everywhere in the air, in the body, in water. Depending on the environment at different speed and with different mechanisms. Locations and mechanism for virion decay are:
* Particles and surfaces exposed to sunlight reach easily temperatures over 45 degrees. At this temperature virions don't stay intact for long [Chan et al 2011](#chan).
* Outdoors during the day there is always UV radiation which destroys virions.
* In the stomach virions are inactivated by acids.


## Measuring Infectious Virions
As described on the page [diagnosis and viral load](./diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) the are several methods to detect the presence of virions. But me

## Temperature




## Sunlight

[in work]
The UV part destroys RNA. Even stable DNA in the inner layer of the skin, protected by outer layer of the skin, a cell membrane and inside a the cell nucleus takes damage from exposure to UV (the more light absorbing melanin the less sunlight reaches the inner layer of the skin).

## Disintegration
[in work]
* digestive enzymes from other organisms e.g. bacteria in water (sea, oceans, rivers) or in the alimentary disintegrate the envelope
* soap destroys the lipid envelope and so the virions

## Decay by Time
[in work]
Single stranded RNA is unstable and thus even under optimal conditions virions have a probability to decay
