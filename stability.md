## Introduction
[Virions](./coronavirus.md#virion) aren't very stable compared to other forms of live. The principal reasons for the instability of virion are:
* The genome is [stored in unstable ssRNA](./coronavirus.md#ssrna)
* The envelope of coronaviruses consists of fatty acids which form the cell membranes of the virus host organism. In multicellular organism the cell membranes have not evolved to be stable outside the organism.
* The spike store have spring loaded energy which is used for cell fusion. Thus the spikes are under tension. On heat, temperature changes or chemical forces they often loose this energy.
* Virions have no metabolism and thus cannot repair any damage occurred.

[Virions](./coronavirus.md#virion) decay happens everywhere in the air, in the body, in water. Depending on the environment at different speed and with different mechanisms. Locations and mechanism for virion decay are:
* Particles and surfaces exposed to sunlight reach easily temperatures over 45 degrees. At this temperature virions don't stay intact for long [Chan et al 2011](#chan).
* Outdoors during the day there is UV radiation which destroys virions even on cloudy days.
* In the stomach virions are inactivated by acids.


## Measuring Infectious Virions
To measure infectious viruses cell culture experiments are necessary. The methods detecting building blocks of viruses (PCR and antigen tests) yield positive regardless whether the virions are intact and infectious (page [diagnosis and viral load](./diagnosis_and_viral_load.md)).

## Decay Rate

### Exponential Decay
When each member of a collection has some time independent chance to replicate or decay during a certain time span independent of the other members, the whole collection growths or decays exponentially. Examples:
* The decay of radioactive material is exponential since each atom has some probability to decay during a fixed time span.
* Change of prevalence of a disease in a homogenous  or at least time homogenous population (time homogenous is approximately true for SARS-2 strains at a very low true prevalence).

### Virion Decay
In most circumstances virions decay independently of each other with a fixed probability during a given time span. Therefore the decay is exponential.

### Measuring Decay Rate
Common measures for the rate of an exponential decay are:
* half life time = 50 % reduction time =  log2 reduction time = time span until half of the collection is decayed = half of the collection is intact
* tenth life time = 90% reduction time = log10 reduction time = time until 90% of the collection is decayed = a tenth of the collection is intact


## Decay Modifiers

### Temperature
[**in work and to check/confirm and cite**]
The temperature increases both the [intrinsic decay](#intrinsic-decay) and the extrinsic effects
* #### Intrinsic Effects 
  The [intrinsic decay mechanisms](#intrinsic-decay) are: Proteins loose functionality, RNA decays, the lipid envelopes looses stability.
  
* #### Extrinsic Effects
  * Temperature changes effect [evaporation and condensation](#evaporation-and-condensation). The water amount changed induces [osmotic forces](#osmotic-pressure).
  * Increased speed of [biochemical reactions](#biological-and-chemical-substances)

The half life times for selected temperatures for coronaviruses:
* 4 degree about: a little more than week = 200 hours
* 20 degrees about: a day = 24 hours
* 30 degrees about: 8 hours

### PH Values
At temperatures around 22 degrees PH values between 3 and 10 don't do much to destroy virions. However changes of the PH values alter the intrinsic decay of virions e.g. at temperatures between 30 degrees and 55 degrees the decay is elevated if the PH value is 8 instead of 7.



## Decay Mechanisms


## Intrinsic Decay Mechanisms
### RNA Decay
RNA is unstable and decays naturally (unless stored at freezing cold temperatures).
### Protein Decay
The proteins especially the spike proteins are subject to decay especially at temperatures above 45 degree.
### Lipid Envelope
The lipid envelope looses stability.

## Extrinsic Decay Mechanisms
### Evaporation and Condensation
Evaporation and condensation affect the concentration of chemical and biological substances. Which can yield clumping or [osmotic pressures](#osmotic-pressure).

### Osmotic Pressure
Droplets of any size in the air or on surfaces are subject to evaporation and condensation. The induced concentration changes of salts and proteins yield osmotic forces. 

### UV Light
[in work]
The UV part of sun light destroys RNA. Even stable DNA in the inner layer of the skin, protected by outer layer of the skin which contains light absorbing melanin (the more light absorbing melanin the less sunlight reaches the inner layer of the skin), a cell membrane and inside the cell nucleus takes damage from exposure to UV.

### Extreme PH Values
While PH values between 3 and 10 just increase the intrinsic decay. PH values below 3 or above 10 actively inactivate CoVs.

### Biological and Chemical Substances
[in work]
* __Digestive enzymes__ from other organisms e.g. bacteria in water (sea, oceans, rivers) or in the alimentary tract disintegrate the envelope.
* __Soap__ destroys the lipid envelope and so the virions.
* __Neutralizing antibodies__ can bind to the spike proteins and thereby the spike proteins loose the functionality to do the cell fusion.
* __Antiviral substances__ found in most body fluids destroy virions e.g. by changing the structure of the spike proteins, destroying the lipid envelope.
* __Proteins__ (even when they do not have enzymatic functions targeting virions) can interact with the spike protein and induce conformation changes whereby the spikes loose the ability to induce cell fusion.
