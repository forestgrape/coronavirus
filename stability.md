## Introduction
[Virions](./coronavirus.md#virion) aren't very stable compared to other forms of live. The principal reasons for the instability of virion are:
* The genome is [stored in unstable ssRNA](./coronavirus.md#ssrna)
* The envelope of coronaviruses consists of fatty acids which form the cell membranes of the virus host organism. In multicellular organism the cell membranes have not evolved to be stable outside the organism.
* The spike store have spring loaded energy which is used for cell fusion. Thus the spikes are under tension. On heat, temperature changes or chemical forces they often loose this energy.
* Virions have no metabolism and thus cannot repair any damage occurred.

[Virions](./coronavirus.md#virion) decay happens everywhere in the air, in the body, in water. Depending on the environment at different speed and with different mechanisms. Locations and mechanism for virion decay are:
* Particles and surfaces exposed to sunlight reach easily temperatures over 45 degrees. At this temperature virions don't stay intact for long [Chan et al 2011](#chan).
* Outdoors during the day there is UV radiation which destroys virions even on cloudy days.
* In the stomach virions are inactivated by acids.



## Measuring Infectious Virions
To measure infectious viruses cell culture experiments are necessary. The methods detecting building blocks of viruses (PCR and antigen tests) yield positive regardless whether the virions are intact and infectious (page [diagnosis and viral load](./diagnosis_and_viral_load.md)).



## Decay Rate

### Exponential Decay
When each member of a collection has some time independent chance to replicate or decay during a certain time span independent of the other members, the whole collection growths or decays exponentially. Examples:
* The decay of radioactive material is exponential since each atom has some probability to decay during a fixed time span.
* Change of prevalence of a disease in a homogenous  or at least time homogenous population (time homogenous is approximately true for SARS-2 strains at a very low true prevalence).

### Virion Decay
In most circumstances virions decay independently of each other with a fixed probability during a given time span. Therefore the decay is exponential.

### Measuring Decay Rate
Common measures for the rate of an exponential decay are:
* half life time = 50 % reduction time =  log2 reduction time = time span until half of the collection is decayed = half of the collection is intact
* tenth life time = 90% reduction time = log10 reduction time = time until 90% of the collection is decayed = a tenth of the collection is intact



## Decay Mechanisms
The decay of virions occurs without and with extern influences denoted as [intrinsic](#intrinsic-decay) and [extrinsic](#extrinsic-decay) here. Factors such as temperature or PH value which modify the rate of other decay mechanism are called [modifiers](#decay-modifiers).



## Factors modifying the Decay

> ##### Decay Modifiers
> A factor which changes the speed/rate of a decay mechanism is called decay modifier.

### Temperature
[**in work and to check/confirm and cite**]
The temperature modifies both the [intrinsic decay](#intrinsic-decay) and the extrinsic effects

* #### Intrinsic Effects 
  The [intrinsic decay mechanisms](#intrinsic-decay) are: Proteins loose functionality, RNA decays, the lipid envelopes looses stability.

* #### Extrinsic Effects
  * Temperature changes effect [evaporation and condensation](#evaporation-and-condensation). The water amount changed induces [osmotic forces](#osmotic-pressure).
  * Increased speed of [biochemical reactions](#biological-and-chemical-substances)

The half life times for selected temperatures for coronaviruses:
* 4 degree about: a little more than week = 200 hours
* 20 degrees about: a day = 24 hours
* 30 degrees about: 8 hours

### PH Values
At temperatures around 22 degrees PH values between 3 and 10 don't do much to destroy virions. However changes of the PH values alter the intrinsic decay of virions e.g. at temperatures between 30 degrees and 55 degrees the decay is elevated if the PH value is 8 instead of 7.



## Decay Mechanisms
Coronavirus virions are composed of three classes of building blocks: RNA, Proteins and a lipid envelope. Each class of these building blocks is subject to decay. From the outside accessible is only the envelope and the spikes.

### RNA Decay
#### Factors influencing RNA Decay
* Temperature
* UV light

#### Possible Changes
* RNA mutates (unless stored at freezing cold temperatures).
* Secondary Structure change
* RNA cleavage

### Protein Decay
#### Factors influencing Protein Decay
* Temperature: The proteins especially the spike proteins are subject to decay especially at temperatures above 45 degree.
* Biochemicals
  * Other Proteins: Other proteins can bind and/or induce conformational changes.
  * Neutralizing Antibodies
 

#### Possible Changes
* Structural changes: The functionality of proteins depends on how the protein is folded.
* Spike Protein
  * Protein cleavage
  * Releasing spring loaded energy.

### Lipid Envelope Decay
#### Factors influencing Protein Decay
* Temperature: The lipid envelope looses stability and becomes more permeable at higher temperatures.
* Osmotic Pressure: can explode the envelope
* Biochemicals: E.g. soap



## Decay Factors

### Evaporation and Condensation
Evaporation and condensation affect the concentration of chemical and biological substances. Which can result in [osmotic pressure](#osmotic-pressure) and concentration changes of [biochemicals](#biochemicals).

### Osmotic Pressure
Droplets of any size in the air or on surfaces are subject to evaporation and condensation. The induced concentration changes of salts and proteins yield osmotic forces. 

### UV Light
[in work]
The UV part of sun light destroys RNA. Even stable DNA in the inner layer of the skin, protected by outer layer of the skin which contains light absorbing melanin (the more light absorbing melanin the less sunlight reaches the inner layer of the skin), a cell membrane and inside the cell nucleus takes damage from exposure to UV. => RNA decay

### PH Values
While PH values between 3 and 10 just adapt the rate of other factors. PH values below 3 or above 10 actively inactivate CoVs. => Proteins, Envelope

### Biochemicals
[in work]
* __Digestive enzymes__ from other organisms e.g. bacteria in water (sea, oceans, rivers) or in the alimentary tract disintegrate the envelope.
* __Soap__ destroys the lipid envelope and so the virions.
* __Neutralizing antibodies__ can bind to the spike proteins and thereby the spike proteins loose the functionality to do the cell fusion.
* __Antiviral substances__ found in most body fluids destroy virions e.g. by changing the structure of the spike proteins, destroying the lipid envelope.
* __Proteins__ (even when they do not have enzymatic functions targeting virions) can interact with the spike protein and induce conformation changes whereby the spikes loose the ability to induce cell fusion.
* __Hydrogen Peroxide__: Denatures Proteins, RNA.
=> Extern substances act on the spike or the envelope.
=> Substances entering the virion can act on intern or extern structures.
