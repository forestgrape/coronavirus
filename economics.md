*  statical in the sense they don't adapt well to changes
*  unequal opportunities in the sense not everybody has equal chances to participate

and the focus is on individual short-term gains:
*  most the systems yield a focus on short-term, acknowledge mid-term to some extent and often completely ignore everything more long-term than the human lifespan. 
*   the focus is on individual benefits, communities and societies tend to be less relevant. Finally everything else is

> ##### Capitalism
> An economic system where most goods are owned privately i.e. by individuals including the goods which are used for production and transfer.

In theory in capitalism allows everyone to have an own realm and so design the economic part of life according to one's own wishes. For that (co)owning production and transfer goods is necessary. However in practice that's not the case for most only for those with sufficient capital. In most situations sufficient means at least 10 times the annual life-o An important part of this page on economics is to provide ideas to fix that.
