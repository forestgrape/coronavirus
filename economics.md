> ##### Economics
> Science about the production, consumption, and transfer of goods and services.

> ##### Economical System
> A framework specifying ownership and transfer of goods and services. 

> ### Baseline Principles
> Principles assumed here.
> 1. We all should be able to live the life we want while respecting the rest of the world doing so too. 
> 2. Building on 1. all should have economic opportunities to pursue the jobs wanted. All should be allowed to make mistakes and so (economic) opportunities are ideally available through the entire lifespan.  (Inspired by John Rawls' theory of justice). Fairness in the following is used in this sense of different appealing opportunities to pursue the economic life. In this sense fair opportunities do not have to be necessarily equal nor the way of life.
> 3. Ideally fairness is achieved by increasing fairness for everybody and not by fixing unfairness for certain subgroups. Singling out and supporting subgroups can yield new unfairness and spinning the wheel one ends up with individuals. So the best is, to start right away with fairness for everybody. 

#### Discover Unfairness
Temporarily partitioning the society into groups can help to discover unfairness in the system i.e. structural. 
* The partitioning can be done for all possible 'coordinates' e.g. genetic, extern appearance, location of residence or birth, wealth, date of birth (e.g. statistical analyses show that the month of birth plays a role in the success for a professional team sports career: the ones being the oldest in the sport-year seem to have slightly better chances. Well there are more important things to tackle.)
* The partitioning is only temporarily for analyses, we live together not separated. 

In many parts of todays world:
* The opportunities children will have in their future life depend largely on the wealth and social status of their parents. Especially in countries where good education is difficult to access => universal access to good education helps.
* The opportunities in the economic life depend to a large extent on streamlined CVs from well known institutions (e.g. companies, universities) and available capital. Especially in countries where the economy is dominated by large conventional companies => Free markets in agile economies should help. 
  > Activities such as educating children can be as instructive as working in a large company, one learns to manage, to teach ...

  > Teaching (across all age groups and all levels from elementary to academics) I consider as very instructive and literally shaped/s my thinking.

## Summary
[**in work**]
From time to time parts of the economy are shaken, local or worldwide, in specific branches or uniform. Covid-19 does so in specific branches. Usually governments need to support both companies and individuals. An ideal economical system would adapt itself to a changed environment. The goal here is to improve the financial system to make the economy more resilient, adaptable and fair. 

1. First classical support measures are listed and pro and contras discussed. 
   * targeted support is complicated and can be unfair since some fall through the nets
   * current methods to increase liquidity (e.g. lowering interest rates) poor money on banks and big companies (so much many don't know what to do with it) but the money doesn't flow well to individuals. Reasons are:
     * that handing out credits is work and so handing out small credits is not lucrative. 
     * credits are often secured and those who need them most can often not provide any security. 
2. A universal credit framework is proposed with the goals:
     * Enable everybody to design the economic life
     * and thereby create a fairer economy
     * Improves the resilience and adaptability of the economical system since everybody has the capability to reorganize and reorientate
     * Many existing social support systems (e.g. unemployment support, student loans) can be integrated to/replace by a universal capital/credit system. 

3. Ideas to implement such a system are sketched:
   * Lower interest rates on money handed to financial institutions that is spend on small credits
   * Flexible payback scheme similar or based on tax systems. The idea is that those who are fortune payback much more than those who are less fortunate. The credits expire after some decades.
   * Financial services as basic infrastructure such as education or streets

4. The credit system is accompanied by a modern infrastructure framework. Till the 19th century, a save workplace and good transportation was often enough when combined with skill and work. Now in the 21th century more infrastructure is needed to provide everybody with fundamentals to succeed:
   * Education options (from child care to IT courses for seniors)
   * Transportation and Telecommunication
   * Health care
   * Accessible Production Infrastructure (not everything can be homemade competitively)

## Thoughts about Economical Systems
[in work]
Most current economic systems are not optimal regarding the [baseline principles](#baseline-principles):
*  *only few can/have to chance to freely choose*: top down management and adaption 
*  *sometimes unfair*: unequal opportunities in the sense not everybody has equal chances to choose how to participate and design.

For the time being only capitalism is discussed.

### Capitalism

> ##### Capitalism
> An economic system where most goods are owned privately including the goods which are used for production and transfer. 

> In capitalism, those with capital control most of the production and thus the economy and thus have a lot power. So word capitalism is a fitting description.
 
In theory capitalism allows everyone to have an own realm and so design the economic part of life according to one's own wishes. For that (co)owning production and transfer goods is necessary. However owning these goods requires sufficient capital. Sufficient depends on the situation, but it often means at least 10 times the annual living-costs. 
> // Everybody and every community smaller or larger having its own realm I think is a good thing. It is how we evolved and how we think and like to think. Capitalism can be a suitable system providing that. However most current implementations of capitalism fall short in the sense that access to capital (services) is not universal. Exploring I ideas how to adapt to achieve this are considered here. 


#### Liquidity in Capitalism
Most implementations of capitalism work as follows:
* a National Bank controls the amount of money and lends it to financial service providers (usually banks) with some interest rates
* the banks lend that money accompanied with financial services to the public. The fees for the services and together with the risk are earned back through interest rates.



## Government Support
Government support options for the economy. 

### Acyclic Spending
Depends on what the state owns and whether a short term increase in spending is beneficial.
Most states own/control:
* **infrastructure**: e.g. transport and public buildings: well suited for acyclic investment since the infrastructure usually last several decades and often there is some freedom in the timing of renewal. 
* **education systems**: mostly the need for education is steady and so short term push makes only sense in certain situations
* **administration**: the need for administration tends to be steady and so short term increase makes only sense in rare situations and tends to be limited. 



#### Adequate Situations
Acyclic government funding works especially well if the crisis involve construction branches.

* Bank Crisis 2009
  In the bank crisis acyclic investment in infrastructure was suitable because the real estate sector was hard hit and so acyclic investment in construction was possible. 
* Covid Crisis 2020
  Only targeted economies (international travel, gastronomy, culture) are hit and in these the government is often not involved. 

### Lowering the Interest Rates 
The interest rates are set by the national banks. Most are (formally and/or to some extent) independent of the government and their goal is defined in the constitution [to confirm]. Often the goal is to supply sufficient money for the economics to be running well and keep the inflation in an interval conforming the economic goals. Nevertheless the national banks and thus setting the interest rates are part of the wider government.

Lowering the interest rates gets the banks access to cheaper money which in turn can provide cheaper credits to cooperates or individuals and they in turn invest the money. Usually these investments create additional demand

#### Adequate Situations
Low interest rates yield more liquidity. Liquidity in turn can yield more investments and thus can catalyze the transformation of the economy.

#### Pro/Contra
* A main drawback is that the money flow is top down. From the bank to large companies and usually not much and only retarded the liquidity reaches small businesses.
  * slow effect since mostly top down: the banks lower their credits rates but mostly likely for large businesses only (small business credits require time to scale since risk checking and so on requires time and personal). Large cooperates discuss whether to take and what to do with additional money, then decisions need to flow through the hierarchy and possible multiple times. So until new jobs are created a lot time passes 
  * the jobs are created top down and may not those jobs people reorganizing are looking for or qualified. 

### Targeted Financial Support 
[**in work and incomplete**]
Governments can support targeted businesses or individuals.

#### Individuals
* Unemployment/Low income Support
* (Additional) support for (essential) services e.g. health care, education, food, transportation
* Support can be via businesses e.g. subsidize salaries

#### Businesses
* Compensate Income Loss
  * effect: businesses can keep running as before
* Support Salaries (the businesses are supported to pay the salaries. The businesses profit since they can keep the employees and thus are ready to restart)
* Liquidity measures: Credit scheme or guarantees

> // Short-term support in case of sudden changes can be adequate to prevent disruption. Mid-term and long-term, credit markets mostly work for businesses.  Businesses providing important social services can be considered worth supporting. However subsidizing important social services is an alternative  (i.e. support all providing important social services but coupled to requirements on the services).

#### Pro/Contra
[in work]


### Universal Financial Support
Also called Helicopter Money. Hand out many to everybody. The idea is that the initial consumption starts economic cycles i.e. the initial consumptions yields well going businesses which then invest and generate in turn demands. 
#### Effects
* Individuals/households tend to spend additional money quickly, so a timely increase in private consumption is the result.
#### Pro
+ timely
#### Contra
- very expensive and thus increasing debt
- may not help those enough who need it most

### Financial Support versus Capital Services
Financial services denotes capital support without any refund mechanism: 
> ###### Financial Support
> On this page: *Financial Support* denotes credits without repayment/refund or any other financial obligation.

Capital services on the other hand, denote capital provided subject to some refund mechanism:
> ###### Capital Services
> On this page: *Capital Services* provide a legal person with capital and possible advices/guidance in trade to some owe value/return rule. Examples are: classical credits with some interest rate, share/stock in return for initial capital and (convertible) loans.


### Capital Services
[Capital services](#capital-services) such as credits/convertible loans and guarantees can be provided to legal persons needing liquidity. To provide business with capital these tools are often used. Examples are:
* loans to businesses often with interest rates below markets
* guarantees for credits
* convertible loans

Capital services usually are not available for private persons. However I consider these an important options since it would give universal access to rebuild or reorganize the life if needed. 

#### Pro/Contra
* Unlike financial support, capital services can be provided near universally, since only those in need will take them.


## Capital Services for Everybody

### Reasons for Universal Capital Services
To fully take advantage a capitalism capital is needed. 
Today in most countries capital access depends on the capital status: 
* Those with capital have access to a whole range of financial services either directly or through founding a new legal persons (e.g. joint-stock company). Companies can have limited liability and so are disposable in the sense that upon bankruptcy there's no liability for the owners. 
* Private credits for those without much capital are often limited to credits for goods which can be resold e.g. houses and consumption credits for electronics or cars. Often such credits have stringent liabilities. 

### Current Problem
Providing capital services is associated with work:
* risk and credibility checking
* check & advise & improve business plan
* accompanying the capital e.g. check if interest rates are paid regularly

The work is per credit and not per amount of credit. Therefor handing out small credits is often not lucrative for financial institutions. 

### Goal
Make capital services available to everybody by designing a framework which makes it attractive to hand out small and medium size funds.

### Experiences with increased Availability of Capital Services 
* Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in the US: federal regulator rate banks how well they invest into different neighborhoods especially if they invest into low- or mid-income communities. The rating is considered for approval of bank mergers, acquisitions and such. (W Kenton, updated 18.8.2020, investopedia.com)
  * "Using recent empirical evidence, I demonstrate that over the last decade CRA has enhanced access to credit for low-income, moderate-income, and minority borrowers at relatively low cost, consistent with the theory that CRA is helping to overcome market failures." [Barr](#barr)
  * "CRA loans have a statistically significant positive effect on small business growth" [Rupasingha](#Rupasingha)
* Micro-credits
  In Bangladesh and countries in South East Asia positive experiences have been gathered with micro-credits [in work]. 

### Proposals for Implementation 
* lower interest rates by the national bank on money handed out as micro & small credits (the rates likely need to be a couple percentages lower) => more attractive for banks to hand out small credits
* payback scheme based on or similar to tax system => those with a large fortune are able to payback more
* possibly payback with taxes => easier to manage and structures already in place
* the credits/funds should have an expiration date (e.g. 15 years) and so allowing a restart.
