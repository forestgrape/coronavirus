#### Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study

* In a Chinese macaque model of SARS-CoV, salivary gland ducts were early targets of SARS-CoV and, therefore, were a likely source of the virions found in patients’ saliva, particularly early in infection.29 Because of these important findings, our study used posterior oropharyngeal saliva brought up by a throat-clearing manoeuvre to ascertain the temporal viral load profile. The posterior oropharynx is the meeting point between secretions coming from the posterior nasopharynx and the salivary glands and respiratory secretions swept up from the tracheal-bronchial tree. Testing of saliva could show viral shedding from both the salivary glands and the upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, because of greater patient acceptability for posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples than for naso- pharyngeal or throat swabs, we obtained 7·5 respiratory specimens per patient for testing. Thus, our temporal viral load profile can be analysed by statistics, unlike previous clinical studies of viral kinetics of infections by highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses.8,16 Further studies are needed to ascertain whether the salivary glands can be infected by SARS-CoV-2.

* Despite development of antibodies against surface and internal proteins of SARS-CoV-2, viral RNA could still be detected in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from a third of patients for 20 days or longer. Peak viral load correlated positively with age. Most patients had an antibody response at 10 days or later after onset of symptoms. Viral whole-genome sequencing of paired samples from four patients did not identify any single nucleotide polymorphisms.
