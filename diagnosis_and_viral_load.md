## Summary
There are different methods and locations to diagnose Covid-19. 
### Overview of Methods
* the [viral load](#viral-load) such as antigen test or PCR tests. PCR test offer a little better sensitivity and specificity but the sensitivity depends mainly on the location. 
* detect infections indirectly e.g. visual changes in the lungs by a CT. Good sensitivity for serious lung infections. Other lung infections can look somewhat similar.  
* antibodies which are part of the immune response. High specificity. Very low sensitivity in the early phase since antibodies are not yet produced. Higher sensitivity later on since most people produce antibodies. 

### Overview of Locations
The viral load  can be detected and measured at different locations.  The viral loads and corresponding detection rates vary greatly between different locations since as described in the chapter [Covid-19](./covid19.md) SARS-CoV-2 can infect many locations and virions are distributed with fluid such as air in the respiratory tract. Some locations are easy to sample such as saliva or the nose swabs but detection rates are low (depending on the method and the infection they vary between 40% and 70%). Other methods are more cumbersome to sample such as nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid but offer higher sensitivities.
Detection rates and viral load for diagnose locations:
* The de facto standard method NPS analyzed by PCR has a detection rate of about  55% across infections. 
* Morning before eat saliva analyzed by PCR has a detection rate of about 60% - 70% so higher than NPS.
* The high detection rates have morning sputum and nasopharyngeal aspirate.

### Take Away
Recommended: Morning sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate,  repeated morning saliva
With Reservation: The standard methods nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) has only a detection rate of 50% - 60%. CTs of the lungs works to detect possible super spreaders but there's radiation. 


## History of Covid-19 Diagnosis
* In late 2019 and January 2020 Covid-19 was mostly diagnosed based on lung CT findings.
* In February 2020 PCR test became more widely available and often specimens from the lower respiratory tract such as BALF or sputum were used. 
* From February/March 2020 to December 2020 the standard SARS-CoV-2 tests are nasopharyngeal swabs in most locations of the world. The viral load is detected either by [PCR-Test](#pcr-test) or [Antigen-Tests](#antigen-test). 

  > In the very early phase of the Covid-19 pandemics PCR test were scarce and antigen tests not available so the work for BALF/sputum sampling was not the bottleneck. In the next months PCR test became more widely available but still limited, nasopharyngeal swabs were used: NPS sampling was doable since testing capacity was still limited. Everybody then just kept on doing NPS even there have been early studies pointing to the benefits of other methods such as self collected saliva. 
* Late 2020 antigen tests are getting more common.
* 2021? Alternate Locations? [Rethink Diagnosis](#diagnosis-locations) and a chapter on its own devoted to [saliva based diagnosis](#saliva-based-diagnosis).



## Methods to Directly Detect Viruses

### Detect Building Blocks of Viruses
In tissues containing infected cells or in the lining fluids protecting/cleaning these tissues the viral load can be measured by detecting building blocks. 

#### Detect the Genome
Test for specific sequences in the genome of virions (positive single stranded RNA for coronaviruses). The amount of virions (called [viral load](#viral-load)) - can be determined with high specificity and sensitivity. Examples are given in the section [Common Diagnosis Methods](#common-diagnosis-methods).

> ###### PCR Test
> A *PCR test* is a method to detect RNA or DNA of life forms.

A viral load higher than several thousand copies per milliliter can be  detected by PCR tests.

#### Detect the Proteins
Methods detecting proteins of virions are usually called antigen tests (virus proteins are called antigens since these proteins can be recognized by the immune system as harmful).
* There are many different products of antigen tests which vary a lot in sensitivity and specificity.
* The sensitivity and specificity of antigen tests tend to be lower than PCR based tests for most antigen test kits available as of December 2020.

> ###### Antigen Test
> Proteins can act as antigens and there are ways to produce antibodies which bind to them (either artificially or). 

### Detect Metabolism of Viruses
Coronaviruses produce temporary RNA similar to mRNA of DNA based life forms can be detected by [PCR-Tests](#pcr-test). This RNA is not packaged into virions and therefore decays quickly and therefore can be used to detect a running metabolism of coronaviruses. 

### Detect Infectious Virions
[in work: to be checked and incomplete]
Samples possibly containing virions can be put on cell or organ cultures. These cell or organ cultures then can be inspected by another methods such as detecting tissue change/damage or detecting RNA to see whether there were infectious virions in the  samples. One reason this is useful is to detect whether and how long infected individuals shed infectious virions. 
##### Cell Cultures
##### Organ Cultures
##### Plague Assays
The samples can be diluted so much that virus colonies originating from single virions can be distinguished. In this  way the number of infectious virions can be determined (this method is called Plaque assay)


## Methods to Indirectly Detect Viruses

### Detect Tissue damage
* chemical e.g. detecting cell damage through distinctive proteins.
  (-) not specific
* optical e.g. round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid-19 [in work and to check/specify and cite]
  (+) quite specific in the lung
  (-) in the upper respiratory tract, tissue damage to low
### Detect Immune Response
#### Antibody Test
[in work] 
For infections triggering certain alarms, the immune response involves antibodies which can be detected in the blood. The antibodies are in the serum of the blood. There are different kind of antibodies which are produced at different stages during and after an infection. Only infections in later stages and past infections can be diagnosed by this method since some a couple of days are needed to produce antibodies. 

> ###### Serology
> Methods analyzing the blood serum are called *serology* and often antibody test are referred serological (Covid) tests. 


### Types of Specimens

Coronaviruses have the habit of releasing their virions of the apical side of cells in epithelium tissues ([Orientation Matters](./coronavirus.md#orientation-matters)). Thus virions are detected by sampling the surfaces of tissues and biopsies are mostly not necessary. The surfaces of tissues are often covered by mucus or fluids which can be collected either by [swabs](#swab) or by [aspiration](#aspirate). If the tissues surfaces are not covered the surfaces can be washed with an appropriate fluid and collected by aspiration. 

> ###### Aspirate
> An *aspirate* is a fluid that is collected by suction (aspirare means breathing).

> ###### Swab
> A *swab* is an absorbent pad or piece of material used in medicine e.g. to collect mucus specimens. 

> ###### Biopsy
> A *biopsy* is a tissue sample taken for the diagnostic purposes. 

> ###### Autopsy
> *Autopsies* are tissue specimens taken post mortem. They are useful for the analysis of the viral load in different organs. 


### Diagnosis Locations
Two types of locations are suitable for diagnosis: 
* Tissues with active viral replication
* Viral Load in body fluids ([Viral Load](#viral-load)) from virus replication in close tissues or deposition. 

The fluids in the respiratory tract are a good locations to detect SARS-CoV-2 virions:
* Since SARS-CoV-2 infects and transmits mainly through the respiratory tract
* The virions mostly are released on the apical side and therefore there are virions in the fluids covering infected tissues. 
* For accessibility reasons fluids in the upper respiratory are preferred. However the largest number of susceptible cells to SARS-CoV-2 are in the lower respiratory tract.

### Common Diagnosis Methods
* [Nasopharyngeal Swabs](#nasopharyngeal-swabs) 
* [saliva Diagnosis](#saliva-diagnosis)
* [Lung CT](#lung-ct)

#### Nasopharyngeal Swabs
Nasopharyngeal Swabs (NPS) are, as of december 2020, often used as 'gold standard' for Covid-19 diagnosis. NPS samples can be analyzed either by PCR or antigen tests.
* quite easy to take but trained persons are needed
* the sensitivity is about 50 - 60%


#### Saliva
Described in the section [saliva based Diagnosis](#saliva-based-diagnosis).

#### Lung CT
Round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid [to check and cite]
(+) specific
(+) detects infection of the lung regardless whether there are viruses in the upper respiratory tract
(-) radiation exposure for patient
(-) only in diseases involving the lung significantly and thus sensitivity low
=> recommended for symptomatic risk patients of very high age (radiation exposure less relevant) with negative test in the upper respiratory tract


### Challenges regarding Viral Load and Diagnosis
Often investigations for viral load are biased. Reasons are:
* Sampling is biased towards symptomatic patients. Not necessarily bad since symptomatic patients are more infectious ([Section Infectors and Symptoms](./spread_analyses.md#infectors-and-symptoms) in the Chapter Spread Analyses) and more at risk for severe disease.
* Often NPS samples are taking as a 'Gold Standard' to diagnose Covid-19. Measuring viral load e.g. in saliva is often compared to NPS viral load and sometimes NPS sampling is assigned a sensitivity of 100%. 
  > I guess/estimate the sensitivity of NPS testing at a single time point lower than 75%
* E.g. not to every infection in the upper respiratory tract the body responds with antibodies or only antibodies of a specific type. On the other hand a lower respiratory tract infection may yield antibodies, but be negative at a single PCR in the upper respiratory tract.



## Viral Load at different Locations
[**in work and unfinished**]

> ##### Viral Load
> The *viral load* denotes how many virions are present in specimen of tissue or body fluid.


### Relevance of Viral Load
Knowing the viral load observed in different fluids and tissues is relevant for:
* __Diagnosis__: For an optimal diagnosis location, the viral load is detectable across the different disease patterns caused by SARS-CoV-2 and taking specimens is easy.
* __Transmission__: Knowing the viral load in different locations helps to understand and prevent transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 virions.
* __Understanding Covid-19__: Knowing at which stages which locations are infected helps to predict the disease. Which is important to predict possible damage and to do the right treatment. 


### Formation of Viral Load
A viral load is observed in locations playing different roles in an infection:
* __Primary infection locations__: the viruses replicate to high numbers and spread to other locations inside the organism and other organisms.
* __Minor infection locations__: Deposited virions can infect local cells and thus the viral load is amplified. However these locations play only a minor role in the disease and transmission of the viruses.
* __Deposit only locations__: Virions are deposited but do *not* replicate: They are either inactivated or there are no susceptible cells. E.g. fluids from the respiratory tract are cleared towards the stomach where the virions are destroyed by the stomach acid. Therefore in the stomach, respiratory parasites can be detected but usually they do not infect the stomach. Deposit only locations are not reliable for diagnosis however, since the viral load is to low to be detected.

For SARS-CoV-2 the lungs is primarily infected and both responsible for the spread to other persons and the symptoms. The salivary gland can act both as minor and major infection locations. Susceptible cells in the nose and in the salivary glands which support SARS-CoV-2 replication. Deposited virions can replicate and so the viral load is amplified in these locations. Therefore the nose mucus or saliva often have a detectable viral load and thus are suitable for diagnosis. 



<!--
### Body Fluids
Coronaviruses virions are mostly released on the apical surfaces and so the virions in the fluids covering infected cells, these can be detected 

#### Tissues Samples
Tissues biopsies show how much virions penetrate inside tissues and organs. 
-->


## Viral Load in Fluids
[in work] A recommended review for the viral load in upper respiratory tract specimens is [Lee et al](#summary-review-lee).

### Viral Load in the Mouth 
If sampling saliva in the morning before eating as done by [Wyllie et al](#summary-wyllie-letter):
* The viral load in saliva can be as high as 10^10 copies/milliliter.
* A viral load above a detection threshold of 10^4 copies/milliliter is observed in about 70% of the Covid-19 infected. 

### Posterior Nose Mucus
Can be sampled by 
* nasopharyngeal swabs which is the most used methods for diagnosing Covid-19 (as of December 2020) and has a detection rate of about 60% ([Yang](#summary-yang)). 

### Anterior Nose Mucus
[in work]
In the review of  [Lee et al](#summarized-review-lee) some studies investigating the anterior nose mucus are cited.
### Sputum
[Yang et al](#summary-yang)

### BALF 
Broncho-alveolar-lavage fluid (BALF). Despite the fact that the lower respiratory tract is the most relevant location for viral replication, the viral load is less known especially for mild cases since sampling is complicated. 

### Blood

## Viral Load in Tissues
[on todo list]
#### Lung
#### Kidney
#### Intestine
#### Brain


## Saliva based Diagnosis
Key features of saliva based Covid diagnosis are:
* Saliva is simpler than NPS and suitable for self collection.
* Viral Load: The viral load in saliva depends on the exact method and location of sampling (e.g. throat wash, coughing up sputum) and the time taken (e.g. the saliva flow is increased during eating and decreased at night).
  * Overall the viral load is similar to the viral load in the nose with an  agreement of about 90% but the results vary on the methods used. 
  * The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva mixed with cough up sputum seems to perform as well or even better than NPS ([summary Lee](#summarized-review-lee)). Which is not surprising since [sputum has a high viral load](#sputum). However not everybody may
  * 
 

### Literature on Saliva Diagnosis
Summaries of the papers are in the section [Summarized References](#summarized-references).
* saliva and other diagnosis forms for Covid-19 are concisely described in the recommended introduction of ([Matic et al](#summary-matic)
* Reviews are
  * [Lee et al](#summarized-review-lee)(has nice plots comparing the different sampling methods) 
  * [da Silva](#summarized-review-dasilva)(helpful summaries of studies).
* Carefully carried out investigations are:
  * [Wyllie](#summary-wyllie). Early morning before eat saliva.
  * [Rao](#summary-rao). Early morning before eat saliva.
  * [Huber](#summary-huber). Throat wash specimens. 
  * An interesting read is [Yokota 2](#summary-yokota-2). In his [Opinion Paper](#summary-opinion-by-azzi) L. Azzi opts for saliva based diagnosis and summarizes key points of [Yokota et al](#summary-yokota-2).


### Viral Load in Saliva




### Saliva Sampling Procedures
[in work]
Location of sampling (e.g. throat wash, coughing up sputum) and timing  (e.g. time of day / before after eating since the saliva flow is increased during & after eating and decreased at night). Thus different [saliva Sampling Procedures](#saliva-sampling-procedures) yield different results. 

* ##### Throat saliva
  Testees in [Huber et al](#summary-huber) were asked to clear the throat. A first group of testees were asked to clear the throat thoroughly (“Basic”, N = 835) and a second group to clear it three times (“Enhanced”, N = 352). A tendency for the enhanced protocol to yield a slightly higher sensitivity is observed.
* ##### Coughed up Sputum
* ##### Early Morning saliva
* ##### Saline Gargle
  [Berenger et al](#summary-berenger) hast testees in a first round gargle saline water and in a second round to accumulate and then spit saliva and add universal transport medium (UTM). The sensitivity observed in the UTM method is higher than in the saline gargle method.

#### Summarized Review Mazumder
**Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2: current status and issues**
Different diagnostic tests for Covid-19 are reviewed and pro & contras discussed:
* Virus culture:
  Not recommended for routine diagnosis since: Requires skilled workers, high biosafety & 3-6 days for SARS-CoV-2 to cause apparent cytopathic effects.
* Molecular assays (references for each specimen in the paper):
  Specimen              | Sensitivity (%)
  --|--
  Nasopharyngeal swab   | 63 – 89
  Oropharyngeal swab    | 32 – 84
  Bronchoalveolar lavage| 93
  Sputum                | 72
  Blood                 | 3 – 15
  Feces                 | 10
  Anal swab             | 10-21.2
* Immunoassays (antigen tests):
  A challenge is especially specificity since: "Within a genus, antibodies against other coronaviruses might cross-react and such cross-reactive conserved viral proteins limit the use of whole virus–based assays, for example, immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [7]."
* Symptom-based diagnosis

##### Methods
Saliva samples of 25 patients with severe COVID-19 are analyzed by rRT-PCR.
##### Results
* "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all 25 patients first salivary swab, with different Ct values (range 18.12–32.23, mean value 27.16 +/− 3.07), but all of them were under the Ct value of 33."
* "Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation between the LDH values recorded in the haematochemical analyses and the Ct values, thus the viral load detected in the saliva was correlated to the tissue damage reported by biomarkers (p = 0.04) (Table 2) (Fig. 1a and b)."
* "In contrast, there was not a significant correlation between usRCT and the Ct values (p = 0.07), but an inverse tendency between this inflammatory index and the viral load detected in saliva (Fig. 1c and d) was observed."
* "A striking feature was highlighted in two patients who showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar swabs proved to be negative."

* Collection Methods:
  1. __saliva Saline gargle__:
     * "For the saline gargle and spit method, participants took 3 mL of 0.85% sterile saline into their mouth, moved it back and forth to each side of the mouth twice, then gargled for 3 s and spat into a sterile polypropylene urine collection container (~4 cm wide)."

We therefore decided to test the method of Pasomsub et al. in a larger number of patients." 
     * "For the UTM (universal transport medium) method, participants accumulated saliva for 1 - 2 min (no specific volume) and spat into an empty urine container, and then 3 mL of Copan Italia UTM-RT (Code 330C) was immediately added."

* "Adults and children that qualified for a regular SARS-CoV-2 test according to the FOPH (Swiss federal office of public health) and reported to one of the participating test centers or emergency units were enrolled from October 20, 2020 to November 4, 2020. In total 1187 individuals (male 54.8%/female 45.2%) were included (Table1)." 
* "Participants were either asked to clear the throat thoroughly (“Basic”, N = 835) or in an intensified protocol to clear it three times (“Enhanced”, N = 352) and collect about 0.5 – 1 ml of saliva."
* "In the present study, neither eating, drinking nor smoking was controlled as study subjects came for an elective analysis by NPS and thus could only be informed about the saliva sampling on site immediately before the collection."
*  "Immediately after saliva collection, VTM (virus transport medium) was added to the crude saliva and the content mixed through gentle twisting." 
*  "Saliva was collected directly after NPS and both specimens immediately sent for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing."

* In Figure 4 A the measurements points are plotted in a NPS-viral-load to saliva-viral-load coordinate system. Findings:
  * People experiencing strong symptoms tend to have a higher viral load (lower CT values) both in NPS and saliva. 
  * The NPS viral load is higher for the majority of testees.
  * The viral load in saliva and NPS differs a lot for some testees.
* Figure 4 B shows that earlier after symptom onset (only symptomatic patients) patients get tested, the higher the viral load is. 



#### Summary Matic
**Practical challenges to the clinical implementation of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection**
The introduction section of their paper is highly recommended: it provides a concise overview of the different diagnostic methods and associated challenges.

Experiments:
1. Comparison of saliva and NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection (Experiment 1)
2. Whether delayed analysis of saliva samples reduces detection rates (Experiment 2) 

##### Methods
__Experiment 1 Comparing NPS and saliva Diagnosis:__
* Testees: "From March–May 2020, paired saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were received from patients under investigation for COVID-19 from various clinical settings: inpatients, residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities, healthcare workers, and outpatients."
* NPS Collection: "Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected using COPAN Flocked Swab with 2 mL of Universal Transport MediumTM (COPAN, Brescia, Italy) or 3 mL of BDTM Universal Viral Transport System (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), depending on availability."
* saliva Collection: "After the nasopharyngeal swab was collected, patients were asked to provide approximately 1 mL of saliva by pooling saliva in the mouth and spitting into a sterile screw-top container (Starplex Scientific Inc., Etobicoke, Canada)."
  
__Experiment 2 Stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for Detection__
Five saliva samples (2 from patients and 3 from volunteers spiked with known positive NPS samples) were stored at room temperature and analyzed at delayed time points: 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h.

##### Results
__Experiment 1 Comparing NPS and saliva Diagnosis:__

##### Methods
"An enhanced saliva specimen (i.e., strong sniff, elicited cough, and collection of saliva/secretions) was collected without transport medium prior to collection of NPS from 224 patients with symptoms deemed consistent with COVID-19."

##### Results
Detection Rate:

Notes:
* 216 of the 224 patients had analyzed both samples without errors (9 errors in total).
* Viral Loads are shown in Figure 1: "Seventy-one percent of the saliva specimens had higher CT values (i.e., lower viral loads) than the matched NPS specimens (Fig. 1B). There was little correlation between the CT values (i.e., viral loads) of the positive saliva and NPS specimens (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.162; P = 0.333) (Fig. 1C)."
* Control Sample Validity: "The mean (SD) CT value of the RNase P amplification control of the NPS specimens was 25.1 (2.2) cycles, whereas the mean (SD) CT value of this target for the saliva specimens was 23.0 (1.8). The mean difference in CT values was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 2.4; P = 0.001), which suggests that the saliva specimens had a greater cellularity than the NPS specimens."

##### Methods
* Participants:
  "This prospective single center diagnostic study was conducted among 217 individuals who were tested positive for SARS- CoV-2 via NPS at a COVID-19 quarantine center, MAEPS. jThese selected individuals were on days 8–10 of isolation during the sampling."..."Individuals with respiratory aid were excluded."
  "All participants were male recruits and asymptomatic at the time of sampling. The median age of the participant was 27 (IQR: 18–36) years." 
* saliva Collection:
  "Before collecting swabs, individuals were asked to provide self-collected deep throat saliva sample in a sterile collection container. Instruction on self-collected deep throat saliva was announced to participants a day prior. Briefly, upon waking up, the individuals were instructed to avoid food, water, and brushing of teeth before the collection of 2 mL of saliva."
* Swab Collection:
  "As a standard protocol, NPS from individuals were collected using sterile flocked swab and placed in sterile tube containing viral transport medium (VTM)."
* Sample Processing
  * "All samples were stored at room temperature and transported to research lab at Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, within 5 hours of sample collection for further processing."
  * In brief: Samples were inactivated at 65 C for 1 hour, nucleic acid extraction by MagNA Pure 96 system and Viral NA Small Volume extraction kit (Roche Diagnostic GmBH, Germany), from 200 μL of viral transport medium containing the NPS or 200 μL of saliva. Testing with 1-step RT-PCR of Real-Q 2019 nCoV detection kit (Biosewoom, Inc, South Korea), which detects the E-gene and RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and human RNase gene as an internal control. 
  * "Samples were classified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 when both E-gene and RdRp primer-probe sets were detected at cycle threshold (Ct) value of <38."

Individuals from two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort had specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples analyzed by PCR.
##### Results
* "In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence at 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva."

##### Methods
* Participants: 
  * Group In-patients: 44 COVID-19 inpatients.  29 of those 44 had paired samples taken (Table 1). Initial Covid-19 diagnosis at hospital admission by NPS for all patients. 
  * Group Healthcare Workers: 485 asymptomatic healthcare workers (e.g., without fever or respiratory symptoms) with occupational exposure to patients with COVID-19 were enrolled.
* Sample Collection: 
  * saliva: "Saliva samples were self-collected by the patient. Upon waking, patients were asked to avoid food, water and brushing of teeth until the sample was collected. Patients were asked to repeatedly spit into a sterile urine cup until roughly a third full of liquid (excluding bubbles), before securely closing it."
  * NPS: "Nasopharyngeal samples were taken by registered nurses using the BD universal viral transport (UVT) system. The flexible, mini-tip swab was passed through the patient's nostril until the posterior nasopharynx was reached, left in place for several seconds to absorb secretions then slowly removed while rotating."
* Sample Handling: "All samples were stored at room temperature and transported to the research lab at the Yale School of Public Health within 5 hours of sample collection."

**Laboratory Diagnosis and Monitoring the Viral Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 Infection**
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2020.100061]()

Location: Shenzhen; Date: written in May, patients likely from January to March
##### Methods
* Participants: "Four hundred and ten patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the Guangdong CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention), who were hospitalized in Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, were included."
* "3,552 respiratory specimens from 410 patients were serially collected during hospitalization, including 559 oropharyngeal swabs, 2,231 nasopharyngeal swabs, 696 sputum samples, and 66 BALF samples."
* "The different types of specimens from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were stratified into three groups based on the collection times: 0–7, 8–14, and R15 d.a.o."

##### Results

It is observed that NPS have quite a low dection rate (only about 60% for mild cases) and sputum has a high detection rate for both mild and severe cases (about 80%). Dection rates adapted and shortened from Table 1 in the paper:

  * While *no* viral RNA was detected in the upper respiratory tract, at the *same* time it was positive in BALF for the cases 01, 03, 07, 11, 12, 13, and 16 (Figure 2).  
  * "Viral RNA was tested negative in the first three or all of the upper respiratory samples. However, viral RNA was detected either by the further detection of upper respiratory samples (cases 21–28) or BALF samples (cases 02, 04, 06, and 07) (Figures 2 and S1)."

#### Summary Zhou
**SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Upper Respiratory Specimens of Infected Patients**
#### Methods
"We analyzed the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients in relation to day of onset of any symptoms (Fig. 1C)." 
#### Results
* "Higher viral loads (inversely related to Ct value) were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat." 
* "Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza4 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV."
* "The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients."
* For many patients the time series of their nasal and throat swabs are varying and don't have single local maxima but several. The viral load can even be undetectable one day and be positive the next day. //=> to exclude infection several negative samples are needed.
