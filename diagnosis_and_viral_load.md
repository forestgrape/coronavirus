## Summary
Different methods to diagnose Covid-19 are discussed. A focus is on methods measuring the amount of viruses (viral load) at different locations. For this reason the topics diagnosis and viral load are discussed in the same chapter.

#### Methods to diagnose Covid-19
* Detect the viruses directly. The amount of viruses ([viral load](#viral-load)) is measured by antigen test or PCR tests.
* Detect infections indirectly by detecting the tissue damage caused e.g. visual changes in the lungs by X-ray images.
* Detect antibodies which are part of the immune response.

#### SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load
Detecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses is highly specific to diagnose Covid-19. PCR tests are able to tell the viral load in virus copies per milliliter of specimen. Antigen tests usually just tell if there are viruses present. For both test methods a certain amount viruses needs to present for a positive test result. SARS-CoV-2 infects the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat) and the lower respiratory tract (bronchi, lungs) and the amount of viruses present at the different locations varies accordingly. So the sensitivity (detection rate) is dependent on the sampling location, the sampling method and the infected locations of the patient. 

Common locations and fluids the viral load is measured are:
* The standard method NPS analyzed by PCR has a detection rate of about  50 - 70 % across infections and the results can vary from sample to sample and day to day.
* Morning before eat saliva analyzed by PCR has a higher detection rate than NPS in the first days of symptom onset (about 10% higher, so 60% - 80%). The viral load, and thus the detection rate, is reduced if the salivary flow is increased (e.g. eating or chewing gums).
* Morning sputum and nasopharyngeal aspirate have high viral load and good detection rates. 
* The viral load in the sputum and in saliva is an indication for disease progression. The viral load in NPS samples is not an indicator. 

#### Take Away
* __Recommended Diagnosis__: Repeated morning saliva specimens yield reliable viral loads which even predict the course of the disease. Morning saliva has shown is effectiveness in the surveillance system in Hong Kong. Sputum helps to diagnose lower respiratory tract infections and the viral load is a predictor for the prognosis. 
* __With Reservation__: The standard methods nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) has a mediocre detection rate of about 60%. Nasopharyngeal aspirate has a good detection rate but is not so easy to sample. XRay/CTs of the lungs work to detect lung infections causing tissue damage (possible super spreaders) but there's radiation. Serum antibodies detect 
* __To keep in mind__: The viral load and the immune responses depend on the infection location, infection severity and the individual immune systems. Therefore there's no all catching diagnose location or method. Not to every infection in the upper respiratory tract the body responds with serum antibodies. On the other hand a lower respiratory tract infection one can be infectious and the infection induces an antibody response, but a single virus test in the upper respiratory tract can be negative.

## Introduction to Diagnosis

A defined in the [Covid-19 chapter](./covid19.md) a [disease](./covid19.md#disease) is a disordering of the body which can be caused by pathogens. For a virus disease, the cause (the viruses) can be detected directly section [Methods to Directly Detect Viruses](#methods-to-directly-detect-viruses)). Possible disordering/damage caused (e.g. tissue damage) and possible induced immune responses can be inspected and indicate indirectly a virus infection (section [Methods to Indirectly Detect Viruses](#methods-to-indirectly-detect-viruses)).

> ###### Diagnosis
> Diagnosis comes from dia ‘apart’ + gignōskein ‘recognize, know’ (British English Thesaurus). Diagnose an illness is to figure out the causes i.e. determine which disease causes the illness. 

## History of Covid-19 Diagnosis
* In late 2019 and January 2020 Covid-19 was mostly diagnosed based on lung CT findings.
* In February 2020 PCR test became more widely available and often specimens from the lower respiratory tract such as BALF or sputum were used. 
* From February/March 2020 to December 2020 the standard SARS-CoV-2 tests are nasopharyngeal swabs in most locations of the world. The viral load is detected either by [PCR-Test](#pcr-test) or [Antigen-Tests](#antigen-test).

  > In the very early phase of the Covid-19 pandemics PCR test were scarce and antigen tests not available so the work for BALF/sputum sampling was not the bottleneck. In the next months PCR test became more widely available but still limited, nasopharyngeal swabs were used: NPS sampling was doable since testing capacity was still limited. Then one just kept on doing NPS even though there have been early studies pointing to the benefits of other methods such as self collected saliva. 
* Late 2020 antigen tests are getting more common.
* 2021? Alternate Locations? Rethink [Diagnosis Locations and Methods](#diagnosis-locations) and a chapter is devoted to [saliva based diagnosis](#saliva-diagnosis).



## Directly Detect Viruses

### Measure Virus Building Blocks

In tissues containing infected cells or in the lining fluids protecting/cleaning these tissues the viral load can be measured by detecting building blocks of virions. The presence of such building blocks in detectable amounts indicate a current or recent virus infection; in the case of a recent infection, there are not necessarily infectious virions around i.e. the viruses are already defeated and there are just parts of viruses around. 

#### Genome Detection
Test for specific sequences in the genome of virions (positive single stranded RNA for coronaviruses). The amount of virions (called [viral load](#viral-load)) - can be determined with high specificity and sensitivity.

> ###### PCR Test
> A *PCR test* is a method to detect specific sequences of RNA or DNA. PCR doubles specific DNA/RNA strands in cycles called CT cycles. The concentration of the DNA/RNA doubles each round, at some point it gets high enough to be detected by some helper method e.g. by optical fluorescence. The doubling cycles needed are called CT values.

##### From CT-value to Concentration
As described the PCR method approximately doubles the viral_load each cycle until detectable by the helper method. To calculate to original viral load, one needs to undo the doubling-cycles. Thus a difference of 10 CT-cycles corresponds to an amplification of 2^10=1024: If 10 additional CT cycles are needed the starting viral load was 1024 times smaller ([Calculation](#calculation-of-viral-load-from-ct_value) in the Appendix).

##### PCR Detection Limit
In theory a single sequence of RNA/DNA can be amplified. Practically PCR apparatuses have a detection limit. Often this is in the order of a few thousand copies per milliliter. This corresponds to a maximal PCR cycle number (often 40). 


#### Protein Detection
Methods detecting proteins of virions are usually called antigen tests (virus proteins are called antigens since these proteins can be recognized by the immune system as harmful).
* There are many different products of antigen tests which vary a lot in sensitivity and specificity.
* The sensitivity and specificity of antigen tests tend to be lower than PCR based tests.

> ###### Antigen Test
> Proteins have specific binding patterns to other proteins. This is used by vertebrates to produces specific proteins (called antibodies) which bind to foreign/unwanted proteins (called antigens). Antigen test work similarly by detecting specific proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (antigens).


### Detect Infectious Virions
[in work: to be checked and incomplete]
Samples, which possibly contain virions, can be put on cell or organ cultures. These cell or organ cultures then can be inspected e.g. by cell damage (cytophatic effects), by detecting tissue change/damage or detecting RNA to see whether and how much the viral load increased. Virus and especially coronavirus culturing is tricky and often requires strict lab security measures, therefore for routine diagnosis virus culturing is not suitable. However virus culturing is very useful for research purposes: e.g. to detect whether and how long infected individuals shed infectious virions. 
##### Cell Cultures

##### Organ Cultures
##### Plague Assays
The samples can be diluted to the point, new virus colonies originating from a single virion can be distinguished on cell or organ cultures (practically always used with cell cultures). The number of virions in the dilution is then equal to the number of colonies.


### Detect Metabolism of Viruses
Coronaviruses produce temporary RNA similar to mRNA of DNA based life forms. This temporary RNA can be detected by [PCR-Tests](#pcr-test). The temporary RNA is *not* packaged into virions and therefore is degraded quickly. Because of the fast degradation, detection of temporary RNA means there are viruses with a running metabolism.



## Methods to Indirectly Detect Viruses

### Detect Tissue damage
Detecting tissue damage is generally not very specific since other diseases e.g. other virus infections cause similar tissue damage.
#### Biochemical 
E.g. detecting cell damage through cell decay products e.g. distinctive proteins. This is useful in combination with other methods: If at a location, SARS-2 viruses are detected combined with above average cell decay products then SARS-2 likely replicates at this location. 
#### Optical 
[in work]
E.g. CT (quite accurate but high radiation to sensible locations) or Xray (less radiation but also less accurate than CT): round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid-19. Other (viral) lung infections look similar so the specificity depends on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 compared other virus infections. 

### Detect Immune Response
#### Antibody Test
[in work] 
For infections triggering certain alarms, the immune response involves antibodies which can be detected in the blood. The antibodies are in the serum of the blood. Different kinds of antibodies are produced at different stages during and after an infection. Only infections in later stages and past infections can be diagnosed by this method since the viruses need first to replicate to high enough titers to trigger an immune response strong enough and then a couple of days are needed to produce a detectable amount of antibodies.

> ###### Serology
> Methods analyzing the blood serum are called *serology*. Antibody detection is referred as serological (Covid) tests. 








## Introduction to Viral Load 
[**in work and unfinished**]

> ##### Viral Load
> The *viral load* denotes how many virions are present in specimen of tissue or body fluid.

#### Relevance of Viral Load
Knowing the viral load observed in different fluids and tissues is relevant for:
* __Diagnosis__: For an optimal diagnosis location, the viral load is detectable across the different disease patterns caused by SARS-CoV-2 and taking specimens is easy.
* __Transmission__: Knowing the viral load in different locations helps to understand and prevent transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 virions.
* __Understanding Covid-19__: Knowing at which stages which locations are infected helps to predict the disease. Which is important to predict possible damage and to do the right treatment.

### Causes for Viral Loads
A viral load can be observed at a specific location for the following reasons:
* __Primary infection locations__: the viruses replicate to high numbers and spread to other locations inside the organism and other organisms. Mainly the lungs, to a lesser extent the mouth e.g. salivary glands.
* __Minor infection locations__: Deposited virions can infect local cells and thus the viral load is amplified. However these locations play only a minor role in the disease and transmission of the viruses. In the nose and the mouth are susceptible cells amplifying the viral load.
* __Deposit only locations__: Virions are deposited but do *not* replicate: They are either inactivated or there are no susceptible cells. E.g. fluids from the respiratory tract are cleared towards the stomach where the virions are destroyed by the stomach acid. Therefore in the stomach, respiratory parasites can be detected but usually they do not infect the stomach. Often the viral load in deposit only location is not detectable.

### Specimens with Viral Load
Sampling the surfaces of tissues is usually enough and sampling the tissues itself is not necessary (So for [Specimen Collection](#specimen-collection, swabs or aspirate are enough).
* __Viral Load on Tissue Surfaces:__ Coronaviruses usually release their virions on the apical side of cells in epithelium tissues ([Orientation Matters](./coronavirus.md#orientation-matters)). If the tissue surfaces are not covered by collectable fluids, the surfaces can be washed with an appropriate fluid and collected by aspiration.
* __Viral Load in Body Fluids__
  Fluid specimens can be collected either by [swabs](#swab) or by [aspiration](#aspirate).
  Body fluids can contain viruses since
  * Body fluids cover tissues of virus replication
  * Viruses can be transported to the body fluids. E.g. exhaled virions get deposited to the respiratory tract lining fluids. 
  * Body fluids often contain cells supporting virus replication. Macrophages are susceptible to SARS-2 replication and are present in some body fluids. Even though the blood contain macrophages, SARS-2 replication rarely occurs in the blood since there are strong immune mechanisms.
* __Viral Load in Tissues__ Tissues biopsies/autopsies show the replication of viruses inside tissues and organs and how much the viruses penetrate to tissues. 

### Specimen Collection

Tissues can be sampled in two ways for diagnosis: 
* Tissues with active viral replication. The tissues can either be sampled by a biopsy or by washing them and sucking the cleaning water (called aspiration) or just by swabbing the outer cell layer.
* Viral Load in body fluids. Sampled by swab or aspiration. 

> ###### Aspirate
> An *aspirate* is a fluid that is collected by suction (aspirare is latin for 'to breath').

> ###### Swab
> A *swab* is an absorbent pad or piece of material used in medicine e.g. to collect mucus specimens.

> ###### Biopsy
> A *biopsy* is a tissue sample taken for diagnostic purposes.

> ###### Autopsy
> *Autopsies* are tissue specimens taken post mortem. They are useful for the analysis of the viral load in different organs.

> ###### Sputum Collection
> *Sputum collection* is a special method exploiting the tickling sensitivity of the throat: A saline solution is inhaled provoking a cough (in most individuals) which is captured. 


### Temporal Variation of the Viral Load
The metabolisms of organism vary across situation/activities performed. Many metabolic functions follow also a daily=circadian (circa = about, dies=day) cycle. The fluids used for disease diagnosis often have a daily cycle e.g. sputum and saliva. 

#### Saliva Collection Timing
The saliva is secreted from different glands in the mouth. How much each of these glands secrets depends on activities such as sleeping or eating (very readable described in [Dawes](#summary-dawes)). The saliva flow rate, location and source give rise to different microhabitats for bacteria and viruses. 
* [Carlson-Jones et al](#summary-carlson-jones) investigated these habitats with flow cytometry and observe that both the bacteria and virus like particles concentrations peak after sleep.
* A morning peak is also observed for SARS-CoV-2: [Hung et al](#summary-hung)






## Diagnosis and Viral Load at Different Locations
* For accessibility reasons investigating the upper respiratory is preferred. The viruses cause few tissue damage so sensitive methods such as PCR test/Antigen tests are used to analyze the nose mucus or saliva.
* The largest number of susceptible cells to SARS-CoV-2 are in the lower respiratory tract. Tissue damage can be observed there by imaging (CT/Xray) and the viral load measured by analyzing sputum, endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage.

### Literature for Viral Load and Diagnosis
* A recommended review for the viral load in upper respiratory tract specimens is [Lee et al](#summary-review-lee).
* [Yang et al](#summary-yang) investigated the viral load across locations the respiratory tract.

### Detection Rates
Sensitivity of Different Specimens freely estimated (if no direct data are available then the specimen is estimated from differences to known specimens. E.g. Nasal Swabs have about 10% lower detection rates than NPS so a rounded value of 0.9 * NPS rate is taken). In first week of severe respectively mild symptoms.

Severe  | Mild  | Specimen
--|--|--
65      | 50    | [oropharyngeal](#oropharyngeal-swabs)
85      | 70    | [morning saliva](#saliva-sampling-methods)
70      | 50    | [saliva](#saliva-sampling-methods)
75      | 60    | [NPS](#nasopharyngeal-swabs) 
65      | 50    | [Nasal Swab](#nasal-swab)
90      | 80    | [sputum](#sputum)
90      | 30    | [BALF](#balf)
75      | 25    | [Lung XRay](#xray-imaging) 

Sources: Mainly the [recommended literature](#literature-for-viral-load-and-diagnosis) above but also from other [summarized references](#summarized-references).

### Diagnosis in the Nose
#### Nasopharyngeal Swabs
Nasopharyngeal Swabs (NPS) sample posterior nasopharyngeal mucus and are, as of December 2020, often used as 'gold standard' for Covid-19 diagnosis. NPS samples can be analyzed either by PCR or antigen tests.
* quite easy to take but trained persons are needed
* Sensitivity:
  * [Yang et al](#summary-yang) observe the sensitivities: 85% for severe cases and 62 % for mild cases in first week of illness. In the second week 69% for severe and 53 % for mild cases.
  * 71% in the first 5 days of hospitalization [Wyllie](#summary-wyllie-letter)
  //patients initially positive by NPS so results possibly biased (the study is about evaluating saliva and comparing it to NPS)
* Slow decrease of viral load and high variability across specimens and days ([Zhou](#summary-zhou), Figure B and D in [Wyllie](#summary-wyllie-letter)). (The slow decrease likely since the cleaning of dead cells and dirt is not very fast at the back of the nose. The variability can be explained by a small sampling area).
* Specificity: The specificity to detect infectiousness is low in mild cases (rough estimate about 50%) since the infectiousness peaks early (according to virus culture investigations) and viral RNA decreases slowly in NPS.
 
#### Nasopharyngeal Aspirate
[in work] As NPS nasopharyngeal aspirates samples the back of the nose. Compared to swabs, apirates contain mucus from a much larger area. The large area reduces the randomness and the viral load less variable and the detection rate  superior as observed for other respiratory tract viruses and especially viruses with a lower respiratory tract tropism such as RSV ([Ahluwalia et al](#summary-ahluwalia), [Sung et al](#summary-sung).

#### Nasal Swab
The anterior or mid-turbinate mucus can be swabbed. Overall detection rates tend to about 10% lower than NPS (Figure 5 in [Lee et al](#summarized-review-lee)). [Hanson et al](#summary-hanson) observed about a 10% lower detection for anterior nasal swabs compared to NPS or saliva. 

### Saliva Diagnosis
The sensitivity depends on the timing and the exact protocol. Early morning saliva has high viral loads and good detection rates as described in [Saliva Sampling Procedures](#saliva-sampling-procedures) in the section [saliva based Diagnosis](#saliva-diagnosis). 

> Separate section since I consider saliva diagnosis as the best option for routine Covid diagnosis. 

#### Oropharyngeal Swabs
[Zhou et al](#summary-zhou) compared oropharyngeal swabs to NPS: OPS are more variables and have lower sensitivity. 

### Diagnosis in the Lungs 

#### XRay-Imaging
Conventional XRay or computer tomography (essentially multiple XRay pictures enabling computer assisted construction of 3d image[to check])
Round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid [to check and cite]
(+) specific
(+) detects infection of the lung regardless whether there are viruses in the upper respiratory tract
(-) radiation exposure for patient
(-) only in diseases involving the lung significantly and thus sensitivity low
=> recommended for symptomatic risk patients of very high age (radiation exposure less relevant) with negative test in the upper respiratory tract.

#### Sputum
[in work]
Sputum has a high detection rate: 
* over 80% in the first week of symptoms and over 70% in the second [Yang et al](#summary-yang) both for mild and severe cases. 
* [Wang et al](#summary-wang) observed a detection rate over 70%.
* [Yu et al](#summary-yu) find that sputum predicts the prognosis.

#### Endotracheal Aspirate
[in work]

#### BALF 
Broncho-alveolar-lavage fluid (BALF). Even though the lower respiratory tract is the most relevant location for pathogenesis, the viral load is less known especially for mild cases since sampling is complicated.
[Yang et al](#summary-yang) detected a viral load in all severe cases. The BALF of two mild cases was analyzed in the second week of illness and negative. // Which doesn't exclude there where viruses in the lungs: BALF sampling only collects from a limited area of the lungs and for mild cases it is known from XRay that the lungs are often only locally infected.


### Challenges regarding Viral Load and Diagnosis
Often investigations for viral load are biased. Reasons are:
* Sampling is biased towards symptomatic patients. // Not necessarily bad since symptomatic patients are more infectious ([Section Infectors and Symptoms](./spread_analyses.md#infectors-and-symptoms) in the Chapter Spread Analyses) and at increased risk for severe disease.
* Often NPS samples are taking as a 'Gold Standard' to diagnose Covid-19. Measuring viral load e.g. in saliva is often compared to NPS viral load. Sometimes NPS sampling is assigned a sensitivity of 100%.




## Saliva Diagnosis
Key features of saliva based Covid diagnosis are:

* Viral Load: 
  * The viral load in saliva depends on the exact method and location of sampling (e.g. throat wash, coughing up sputum) and the time taken (e.g. the saliva flow is increased during eating and decreased at night). Overall the viral load is similar to the viral load in the nose with an agreement of about 90%. The results vary across studies and the collections methods they use ([Sampling Methods](#viral-load-for-different-saliva-sampling-methods)). 
  * The optimal [collection time](#saliva-collection-timing) is upon waking up and before eating. In this case the viral load and the detection rate is about 10% higher than in NPS specimens ([Upon Waking Saliva](#upon-waking-saliva))
  * The viral load decrease in saliva is a predictor for the pathogenesis [Silva et al](#summary-silva).
* Handling:
  * The load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA stays stable and is detectable in saliva after some days ([Matic et al](#summary-matic); [Ott et al](#summary-ott))) with and without virus transport media (about half of the studies use some transport media).
* Suitability: 
  * Saliva is simpler than NPS and suitable for self collection.
  * Pooled analysis [citation in work]. 
  * Routine screening, possibly pooled (e.g. in hospitality, offices, care homes)


### Literature on Saliva Diagnosis
Summaries of the papers are in the section [Summarized References](#summarized-references).
* Saliva and other diagnosis forms for Covid-19 are concisely described in the recommended introduction of ([Matic et al](#summary-matic)
* Reviews are
  * [Lee et al](#summarized-review-lee)(has nice plots comparing the different sampling methods) 
  * [da Silva](#summarized-review-dasilva)(helpful summaries of studies).
  * [Manabe et al](#summary-manabe) investigate crevicular fluid and review the literature on saliva diagnosis. 
* Well specified and carefully carried out investigations are:
  * [Wong](#summary-wong). Early morning before eat saliva. Retrospective comparison of saliva to nasopharyngeal samples (mainly swabs but also some aspirates) from testing centers in Hong Kong. 
  * [Wyllie](#summary-wyllie-letter). Early morning before eat saliva. **Recommended** read with illustrative plots, detailed information available in the appendix.
  * [Rao](#summary-rao). Early morning before eat saliva.
  * [Huber](#summary-huber). Throat wash specimens.
* Of interest
  * An interesting read is [Yokota 2](#summary-yokota-2). In his [Opinion Paper](#summary-opinion-by-azzi) L. Azzi opts for saliva based diagnosis and summarizes key points of [Yokota et al](#summary-yokota-2).
  * [Hung et al](#summary-hung) describe the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva at 5 different time point during the day and observe that the viral load peaks in the morning.

### Saliva Sampling Methods
[in work]
Different [saliva Sampling Procedures](#saliva-sampling-procedures) yield different results:
* Different sampling procedures (e.g. throat wash, coughing up sputum) collect saliva from different locations. 
* The timing matters since at a low saliva flow rate (e.g. during night) virus material can accumulate and [the saliva flow is higher after eating and lower during night](#saliva-collection-timing)). 

* #### Upon Waking Saliva
  * [Wyllie et al](#summary-wyllie-letter) analyze saliva samples from hospitalized patients given each couple of days:
    * A viral load is detected in about 80% of the cases in the first 5 days after hospital admission of NPS confirmed Covid-19 cases.
    * Both the viral load and the detection rate observed are higher than for NPS in day 0 to 5 and day 5 to 10 days after hospital admission. From day 11 and onwards about 50% are positive in NPS
  * [Wong](#summary-wong) the detection rate of saliva is on average about 10 % better than nasopharyngeal samples (NPS or NPA and sometimes even mixed with throat swabs).
  * [Rao et al](#summary-rao) observed much higher detection rates from early morning saliva than from NPS specimens in male recruits asymptomatic at the time of testing (average age 27) on day 8-10 in isolation after an initial positive NPS test.
* #### Throat saliva
  Testees (mostly symptomatic or exposed) in [Huber et al](#summary-huber) were asked to clear the throat and then provide a saliva. The viral load and detection rate in NPS were higher but about 90% of NPS positive were also positive in saliva. A tendency for increasing the saliva sensitivity for triple throat washing is observed. 
* #### Coughing up Sputum/Nasal Secretions by sniffing
  * [Procop et al](#summary-procop): 216 Covid-19 symptomatic patients had enhanced saliva (provide different secretions: strong sniff, elicited cough) collected and PCR analyzed. 38 were positive both for NPS and saliva. 1 testee had only saliva tested positive. 
* #### Coughing up
  * [Otto et al](#summary-otto)
* #### Saline Gargle
  [Berenger et al](#summary-berenger): Testees in a first group gargle saline water. Testees in a second group accumulate and then spit saliva which is then mixed with universal transport medium (UTM). The sensitivity observed in the UTM method is higher than in the saline gargle method.
* #### Crevicular Fluid
  Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling is used to diagnose periodontal diseases [citation in work]. 
  * [Manabe et al](#summary-manabe) investigated the effectiveness of crevicular fluid for Covid-19 diagnosis. About 10% lower than NPS in the first 5 days after symptom onset. From days 5 - 10 about 60% of NPS positive samples were positive by GCF.
  * [Gupta et al](#summary-gupta) observe a detection rate about 35% lower than NPS (21 positive out of 33 positive by NPS). 


### Notes
* The validity of saliva and most other specimens can be validated by detecting the RNaseP enzyme (enzyme made from RNA and proteins which degrades extracellular RNA). RNaseP is only contained in correctly taken specimens since: RNaseP is an enzyme which is mostly consisting of RNA and some proteins. RNaseP is released from the cells to extracellular fluids such as mucus, blood or saliva. Its RNA parts can be amplified & detected by PCR.
* Saliva tests can be tricked by increasing the saliva flow ([Dawes](#summary-dawes)). 

  > One reason more to relax the often overly strict [quarantine and isolation rules](./controlling.md#covid-19-cases-and-quarantine). Across the world the [detection rate](./covid19.md#comparing-case-and-infection-fatality) is often below 10%. So 90% aren't sure or even don't know whether they are infected. With a positive test, most are likely careful (even without requirements).

  To determine useful sampling/cheating an option is: Detection of members of the oral flora, since not only coronaviruses but also most other bacteria and viruses peak after sleep ([Carlson-Jones](#summary-carlson-jones)). RNaseP likely does not help: Saliva is essentially ultra-filtrated blood enriched with some enzymes and electrolytes and is secreted from cells in the different salivary glands ([Dawes](#summary-dawes)). Since RNaseP is both in the blood and in the secretory cells, RNaseP does not decrease much on an increased flow rate [to check].

### Viral Load in Different Specimens

#### Summarized Review Mazumder
**Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2: current status and issues**
Different diagnostic tests for Covid-19 are reviewed and pro & contras discussed:
* Virus culture:
  Not recommended for routine diagnosis since: Requires skilled workers, high biosafety & 3-6 days for SARS-CoV-2 to cause apparent cytopathic effects.
* Molecular assays (references for each specimen in the paper, the investigation from [Wang et al](#summary-wang) is one of those):
  Specimen              | Sensitivity (%)
  --|--
  Nasopharyngeal swab   | 63 – 89
  Oropharyngeal swab    | 32 – 84
  Bronchoalveolar lavage| 93
  Sputum                | 72
  Blood                 | 3 – 15
  Feces                 | 10
  Anal swab             | 10-21.2
* Immunoassays (antigen tests):
  A challenge is especially specificity since: "Within a genus, antibodies against other coronaviruses might cross-react and such cross-reactive conserved viral proteins limit the use of whole virus–based assays, for example, immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [7]."
* Symptom-based diagnosis

### Viral Load in Sputum
[in work]


#### Summary Yu
**SARS-CoV-2 viral load in sputum correlates with risk of COVID-19 progression**
##### Methods
* Total 92 patients
  * 30 were severe at hospitalization. 
  * 62 mild-moderate cases at hospitalization, 11 cases became severe during hospitalization.
* "The sputum specimens were collected from the lower respiratory tract of each patient at admission and the levels of viral nuclei acid were determined by a real-time PCR (RT- PCR) approach and indicated by the cycle threshold (Ct) values of RT-PCR assays [2]."
##### Results
"We found that the viral load of the sputum specimen in the lower respiratory tract tested at baseline is closely related to the severity of COVID-19. More importantly, patients with a higher baseline viral load are more likely to become severe." //shown in Figure 1 of the paper.

##### Abbreviations 
POPS = posterior oropharyngeal Saliva = Deep throat saliva
NPsp = Nasopharyngeal specimens (NPsp) = NPS or NPA
NPS = nasopharyngeal swabs  
NPA = nasopharyngeal aspirate //in the paper NPA also denotes negative percent agreement
x/T = specimen x pooled with throat swab

##### Methods
* Participants: Inpatients, ambulatory patients, and symptomatic and asymptomatic outpatients from different surveillance programs and settings e.g. returned travellers. (Table 1)
* Saliva Collection: "In brief, patients were asked to clear saliva from back of the throat into a sterile container as soon as possible after waking up, before any eating, drinking, or teeth brushing."
* NPsp Collection: "... patients were instructed to blow their nose to clear the nostrils..."
  * NPS Collection: "NPS was collected by insertion of a flock swab into the nostril parallel to the palate with a rotatory motion to a depth equal to the distance from the nostril to the tragus [4]. The flock swab was left in the position for a few seconds before removal with a rotatory motion.
  * NPA Collection: "NPA was collected using a catheter connected one end to a mucus trap and the other end to a vacuum source, which is then inserted into the nasopharynx similar to NPS to the nasopharynx for aspiration of nasopharyngeal secretion into the mucus trap.

)

###### All Specimens
* "A total of 13772 POPS and respiratory specimens from 8596 patients were received for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between 1 February 2020 and 15 April 2020, of which 12700 were performed for diagnostic purpose, with an overall positive rate of 1.55%. In particular, the positive rate of specimens sent from “Tier 1” patients and testing centers for symptomatic returned travelers were 8.34% and 6.18%, respectively. " //Tier 1 = Symptomatic patients with epidemiological risk factors.

##### Discussion
* "Hong Kong was the first region in the world to adopt POPS for mass screening in the COVID-19 pandemic. “Deep throat saliva” was the official term used by the government of HKSAR and HA in the promotion materials, but we have used POPS here as per previous publications that better describe the anatomical origin (posterior oropharynx) of the specimen [14]."
* "Our finding might be explained by several reasons. First, POPS specimens might contain both bronchopulmonary secretions and nasopharyngeal secretions [14], that is, a mixed upper and lower respiratory specimen, hence increasing the detection probability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA which affects both upper and lower respiratory tracts. Compared with saliva straight from salivary glands, posterior oropharyngeal saliva appeared to have higher sensitivity [12– 14]."
* "As expected, the percent agreement of POPS-NPsp is higher during the first 7 days of illness [12, 14, 31, 32] which adds to the support that POPS is suitable for the diagnosis of patients presenting during early infection."
* "Moreover, no difference in categorical agreement was noted between POPS collected during early morning compared with other times of the day, implying that “early morning” collection of POPS may not be mandatory. However, it must be noted that all patients included had refrained from eating, drinking and teeth brushing for at least 2 hours before obtaining POPS regardless of actual collection time."

[https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM .01824-20.]()
##### Methods
* Participants: " Adult patients presenting to a drive-through test center with symptoms suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were included. Criteria for testing included the presence of at least one of the following: fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, malaise, chills, and/or a decreased sense of smell or taste."
* Sample Collection: "Flocked minitip and foam swabs (Puritan Medical Products) were used for the nasopharyngeal and nasal swab collections, respectively. Swabs placed in 3 ml of sterile 1 phosphate-buffered saline (ARUP Laboratories) and straight saliva collected in a sterile empty 50-ml Falcon tube (without prealiquoted stabilization medium) were transported to the clinical laboratory at 4 degree."
* "We did not include a host genomic marker to ensure the presence of respiratory epithelial cells on the swab, nor did we compare patient self-collected ANS to health care provider-collected ANS."

* Viral load of NPS and ANasal are positively correlated with ANasal being lower. Saliva values are in some cases very different. (Fig 2)

##### Discussion
* "Additionally, the level of viral replication in the nasopharynx or posterior oropharynx/salivary glands may vary over the course of infection. We did not collect information on the duration or type of symptoms at the time of specimen collection, which is an additional limitation of the study."
* "Lastly, in an attempt to exclude the possibility of RNA degradation in straight saliva as a potential explanation for false-negative results, we performed stability studies at ambient and refrigerated temperatures for up to 5 days and saw no reduced TMA or PCR signal (data not shown)."


#### Summary Gupta
**SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Gingival Crevicular Fluid**
##### Methods
* Participants: 
  * "A total of 33 patients presenting to the Communicable Diseases Ward of the institution between July 1, 2020, and July 25, 2020, were recruited into the study after their COVID-19 status was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab testing."
  * "As far as COVID-19 status is concerned, 20 of these 33 patients were asymptomatic carriers (60.60%) and 13 presented with mild symptoms of fever, cough, and/or sore throat (39.4%). Fourteen of these 33 patients (42.42%) were deemed to have gum disease upon examination."
* "GCF and saliva samples were collected from 33 COVID-19– confirmed patients by trained health care personnel by taking adequate protective measures as per the institute’s guidelines."
##### Results
Table 1 show the patients characteristics including the E-gene Ct-values for NPS, GCF and Saliva. // very nice to have complete data
* Viral Load: 
  * Averages: NPS about 24 Ct-value, GCF about 27 and Saliva about 28 (Figure in Paper)
  * Variability: Larger in NPS (6.3 std) and saliva (5.4). Smaller in GCF (3.9). 
* Detection Rate:
  * 21/33 (64%) by GCF
  * 21/31 (67%) by Saliva
* "Saliva samples tested positive in 3 of the 12 patients whose GCF tested negative, and likewise, GCF tested positive for 2 of the 11 patients whose saliva tested negative on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). "
##### Notes
"Periodontal health has been known to be reflective of sys- temic health. By this extension, GCF has been used in a num- ber of studies to gauge the systemic status of individuals in terms of being indicative of the serum level of immune response. GCF sampling has also been used to reliably deter- mine viral loads while studying periodontal conditions (Grenier et al. 2009)."

<!--
  * "Considering the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the NPS swabs as gold standard, the sensitivity of GCF and saliva, respectively, was found to be 63.64% (CI, 45.1% to 79.60%) and 64.52% (CI, 45.37% to 80.77%)."

A review and meta analysis. Helpful plots showing uniformly the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in NPS/saliva/NS for the reviewed studies and aggregated detection rates for different features (e.g. symptomatic) and different collection methods (NPS/saliva/NS). 
##### Methods
"We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval October 1st, 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types [saliva, oropharyngeal (OP), and nasal (NS) swabs] versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT)." => "From 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting 15 inclusion criteria."
##### Findings
The results from the different studies/data aggregated by feature are summarized to a figure which shows % positive alternate specimens, % positive NP specimens and (if available) % specimens where both NP and alternate are positive. 
Selected aggregated results, the complete list is found in Figure 2 in the paper

> Note: Sensitivity values should be taken as a score and *not* as detection rates in percentages since diagnosis by upper respiratory specimens alone misses many cases [Yang](#summary-yang), [Wang](#summary-wang), [Wyllie](#summary-wyllie-letter)

* Overall saliva has a score of 88 compared to one of 94 for NPS 
* Cough or deep  throat saliva have a score of 94 while NPS have 89.
* Asymptomatic patients have a score of 87 in saliva and 73 in NPS
* Symptomatic Patients have a score of 88 in saliva and 96 in NPS

Helpful summaries of 39 studies, which analyze the viral load in saliva. 
##### Methods
Search for (“saliva”) and (“SARS-CoV-2” or “coronavirus” or “COVID-1”) in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus yielded:
"A total of 363 studies were identified by  and 39 were selected for review."
##### Findings
* For most studies: Saliva samples yielded a viral load and positivity rate similar to NPS samples. 
* For most studies: If NPS samples were positive, saliva samples were positive in 70% or more cases. 
* "Salivary samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection was as consistent and sensitive as the nasopharyngeal swabs in most studies, having been effective in detecting asymptomatic infections previously tested negative in nasopharyngeal samples."


#### Summary Manabe
**Self-collected oral fluid saliva is insensitive compared to nasal-oropharyngeal swabs in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in outpatients**
##### Methods
* Self-collected Swabs: "Participants self-collected mid-turbinate nasal and oropharyngeal (nasal-OP) swabs; both swabs were placed in 3ml viral transport medium (VTM, 11).
* Saliva Collection: 
  * "Participants were instructed to open and remove the saliva collection sponge from the device container, rub their gums for 1-2 minutes with the sponge, then reinsert the swab back into the device container and closes the container. This collection method targets gingival crevicular fluid, which leaks from the space between the gums and teeth and is enriched with IgG antibodies derived from blood."
  * "Midway through enrolment, participants were asked to add spit into the Oracol collection tube to evaluate if that might enhance sensitivity."
* "VeroE6-TMPRSS2 [16] cell culture model was used to assess viable virus when incubated with VTM (nasal-OP samples only). SARS-CoV-2 specific growth was verified by indirect immunofluorescence for SARS-CoV-2 antigen (nucleocapsid and spike proteins).[17]"
##### Results
* In the first 5 days after symptom onset the agreement for positive samples was about 90%. But in days 5 to 10 only about 60% of crevicular fluid samples where positive of the swab positive ones (as shown in Figure 3). 
* "We cultured all rRT-PCR positive nasal-OP specimens on VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells. All culture positive samples (n=16) were obtained within 11 days of symptom onset. In all matched samples in which SARS-CoV-2 was culture positive (n=9), SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by rRT-PCR in both nasal-OP and oral fluid samples."
##### Discussion
* "In our study, we found that spit added to the oral fluid did increase sensitivity. Taken together spit/drool sample type is better than oral fluid from the gumline. These differences are important since many in vitro devices that are currently being tested for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 use different salivary sample types including passive drool, spit, oral fluid collected with a sponge, and sputum from clearing the throat."

##### Methods
* Location: Dubai, 29th June−14th July 2020 at the Al Khawaneej Health Center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).
* Participants: 
  * "An average of 235 patients are screened daily at the center, including contacts of confirmed positive cases, those with presumptive symptoms with or without history of exposure as well as individuals concerned about possible infection." 
  * "The median (IQR) onset of symptoms prior to the test was 2.5 (1–14) days. Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2."
* NPS Collection: Nasopharyngeal swab in universal transport media 
* Saliva Collection: " To ensure consistency in saliva collection, the healthcare personnel were trained in giving instructions to the patients for saliva collection and a unified script was used. Saliva was collected using sterile containers without transport medium and samples were obtained at least one hour after the patient last consumed food, fluid, or smoked tobacco. Patients were asked to pool saliva in their mouth for 1–2 minutes and then gently spit 2–4 mL of saliva into the provided sterile container."
##### Results
"A total of 35 (8.7%) patients showed viral detection by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from at least one specimen type and both the RdRp and N gene targets were detectable in all positive samples. The overall prevalence for COVID-19 diagnosis by swab RT-PCR was 6.5% (n/N=26/401) and 7.0% by saliva RT-PCR (n/N=28/401)."

##### Methods
Saliva samples of 25 patients with severe COVID-19 are analyzed by rRT-PCR.
##### Results
* "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all 25 patients first salivary swab, with different Ct values (range 18.12–32.23, mean value 27.16 +/− 3.07), but all of them were under the Ct value of 33."
* "Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation between the LDH values recorded in the haematochemical analyses and the Ct values, thus the viral load detected in the saliva was correlated to the tissue damage reported by biomarkers (p = 0.04) (Table 2) (Fig. 1a and b)."
* "In contrast, there was not a significant correlation between usRCT and the Ct values (p = 0.07), but an inverse tendency between this inflammatory index and the viral load detected in saliva (Fig. 1c and d) was observed."
* "A striking feature was highlighted in two patients who showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar swabs proved to be negative."

In total 1187 individuals (male 54.8%/female 45.2%) were included (Table1)." 
* "Participants were either asked to clear the throat thoroughly (“Basic”, N = 835) or in an intensified protocol to clear it three times (“Enhanced”, N = 352) and collect about 0.5 – 1 ml of saliva."
* "In the present study, neither eating, drinking nor smoking was controlled as study subjects came for an elective analysis by NPS and thus could only be informed about the saliva sampling on site immediately before the collection."
*  "Immediately after saliva collection, VTM (virus transport medium) was added to the crude saliva and the content mixed through gentle twisting." 
*  "Saliva was collected directly after NPS and both specimens immediately sent for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing."

* In Figure 4 A the measurements points are plotted in a NPS-viral-load to saliva-viral-load coordinate system. Findings:
  * People experiencing strong symptoms tend to have a higher viral load (lower CT values) both in NPS and saliva. 
  * The NPS viral load is higher for the majority of testees.
  * The viral load in saliva and NPS differs a lot for some testees.
* Figure 4 B shows that earlier after symptom onset (mainly symptomatic patients) patients get tested, the higher the viral load is. 


#### Summary Matic
**Practical challenges to the clinical implementation of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection**
The introduction section of their paper is highly recommended: it provides a concise overview of the different diagnostic methods and associated challenges.

Experiments:
1. Comparison of saliva and NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection (Experiment 1)
2. Whether delayed analysis of saliva samples reduces detection rates (Experiment 2) 

##### Methods
__Experiment 1 Comparing NPS and saliva Diagnosis:__
* Testees: "From March–May 2020, paired saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were received from patients under investigation for COVID-19 from various clinical settings: inpatients, residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities, healthcare workers, and outpatients."
* NPS Collection: "Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected using COPAN Flocked Swab with 2 mL of Universal Transport MediumTM (COPAN, Brescia, Italy) or 3 mL of BDTM Universal Viral Transport System (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), depending on availability."
* saliva Collection: "After the nasopharyngeal swab was collected, patients were asked to provide approximately 1 mL of saliva by pooling saliva in the mouth and spitting into a sterile screw-top container (Starplex Scientific Inc., Etobicoke, Canada)."
  
__Experiment 2 Stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for Detection__
Five saliva samples (2 from patients and 3 from volunteers spiked with known positive NPS samples) were stored at room temperature and analyzed at delayed time points: 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h.

##### Results
__Experiment 1 Comparing NPS and saliva Diagnosis:__

J Clin Microbiol 58:e01946-20. [https:// doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01946-20]()
##### Methods
* Location: Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA
* Participants: "Patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as determined by a licensed health care provider and reviewed by a second health care provider, were directed to a specimen collection location."
* Specimen Collection:"If the patient agreed to submit a saliva specimen for comparative purposes, they were provided with a specimen collection cup and given instructions (see the supplemental material) on how to provide the specimen while they waited in line in their car for NPS collection. The patient was instructed to “snuff” (i.e., sniff strongly) to gather any nasal secretion/mucus into the oropharynx, to cough to produce any phlegm, and then to submit these secretions and additional saliva until the specimen reached the premarked fill line on the sterile specimen collection container (also called a urine cup). We requested 3 ml of saliva/naso-oropharyngeal secretions (referred to here as “enhanced saliva”) for this study but accepted whatever volume the patient could provide."

##### Results

--|--|--|--
Saliva        | 24.2   | 23   
NPS           | 20.6   | 25.1

Notes:
* 216 of the 224 patients had analyzed both samples without errors (9 errors in total).
* Viral Loads are shown in Figure 1: "Seventy-one percent of the saliva specimens had higher CT values (i.e., lower viral loads) than the matched NPS specimens (Fig. 1B). There was little correlation between the CT values (i.e., viral loads) of the positive saliva and NPS specimens (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.162; P = 0.333) (Fig. 1C)."
* Control Sample Validity: "The mean (SD) CT value of the RNase P amplification control of the NPS specimens was 25.1 (2.2) cycles, whereas the mean (SD) CT value of this target for the saliva specimens was 23.0 (1.8). The mean difference in CT values was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 2.4; P = 0.001), which suggests that the saliva specimens had a greater cellularity than the NPS specimens."

##### Methods
* Participants:
  "This prospective single center diagnostic study was conducted among 217 individuals who were tested positive for SARS- CoV-2 via NPS at a COVID-19 quarantine center, MAEPS. These selected individuals were on days 8–10 of isolation during the sampling."..."Individuals with respiratory aid were excluded."
  "All participants were male recruits and asymptomatic at the time of sampling. The median age of the participant was 27 (IQR: 18–36) years." 
* Saliva Collection:
  "Before collecting swabs, individuals were asked to provide self-collected deep throat saliva sample in a sterile collection container. Instruction on self-collected deep throat saliva was announced to participants a day prior. Briefly, upon waking up, the individuals were instructed to avoid food, water, and brushing of teeth before the collection of 2 mL of saliva."
* Swab Collection:
  "As a standard protocol, NPS from individuals were collected using sterile flocked swab and placed in sterile tube containing viral transport medium (VTM)."
* Sample Processing
  * "All samples were stored at room temperature and transported to research lab at Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, within 5 hours of sample collection for further processing."
  * In brief: Samples were inactivated at 65 C for 1 hour, nucleic acid extraction by MagNA Pure 96 system and Viral NA Small Volume extraction kit (Roche Diagnostic GmBH, Germany), from 200 μL of viral transport medium containing the NPS or 200 μL of saliva. Testing with 1-step RT-PCR of Real-Q 2019 nCoV detection kit (Biosewoom, Inc, South Korea), which detects the E-gene and RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and human RNase gene as an internal control. 
  * "Samples were classified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 when both E-gene and RdRp primer-probe sets were detected at cycle threshold (Ct) value of <38."

**Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Different Types of Clinical Specimens**
##### Methods
* "We investigated the biodistribution of SARS-CoV-2 among different tissues of inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed based on symptoms and radiology and confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 detection."
* "Most of the patients presented with fever, dry cough, and fatigue; 19% of patients had severe illness." 
* "A cycle threshold value less than 40 is interpreted as positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA." 
* "Four SARS-CoV-2 positive fecal specimens with high copy numbers were cultured, and then electron microscopy was performed to detect live virus."
##### Results
* Positive rates in decreasing order:
  * Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (14 of 15; 93%)
  * Sputum (72 of 104; 69%)
  * Nasal swabs (5 of 8; 62.5%)
  * Fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (6 of 13; 46%)
  * Pharyngeal swabs (126 of 398; 32%)
  * Feces (44 of 153; 29%)
  * Blood (3 of 307; 1%)
  * Urine specimens (0 of 72; 0%) 
* Two of the four cultured fecel samples showed signs of virus replication.


#### Summary Williams
**Saliva as a non-invasive specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2**
##### Methods
* Between 25th March and 1st April 2020 in Melbourne, 622 patients provided NPS samples, 522 of those 622 patients provided additionally saliva samples for Covid-19 tests. 
* Collection Methods:
  saliva: Patients were asked to pool saliva in their mouth for 1-2 minutes prior to collection.
##### Results
* 39 of 622 (6.3%) patients had PCR-positive NPS, and 33 of those 39 NPS positive (84.6%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in saliva.
* 1 positive of 50 (2%) saliva sample of patients whose NPS sample was negative (only the saliva of 50 patiens whose NPS sample was negative was analyzed).
##### Limitations
Data not uniform/consistent:
* Of the 622 patients with NPS samples only 522 provided saliva samples (but not written if the positive 39 belonged to the 522).
* Only 50 saliva samples of those tested negative by NPS were analyzed.

Advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1388
##### Methods
* Participants: Individuals from two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort had specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples analyzed by PCR.
* Saliva Collection: "All neat saliva specimens were self-collected in a sterilized 15mL polystyrene sputum collection tube (Toyo Kizai, Warabi, Japan) and transported at 4°C without transport media." 
* NPS Collection: "The nasopharyngeal samples were collected by using FLOQSwabs (COPAN, Murrieta, CA, USA). The swabs were placed in transport medium and transported at 4°C."
* Analysis: "All NPS samples in the CT cohort were tested by qRT-PCR. The NPS samples in the AQ cohort was tested by either qRT-PCR or reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)[13, 14] at the discretion of the airport quarantine. All saliva samples in both cohorts were analyzed by both qRT-PCR and RT-LAMP."

##### Results
* "In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence at 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva."

##### Discussion
* "Both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity. Self- collected saliva is a valuable specimen to detect SARS-CoV-2 in mass screening of asymptomatic persons."
* "Our study suggests that RT-LAMP may be a useful alternative to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS- CoV-2, especially where diagnosis is required at the point of sample collection."

### Time Series of Viral Load in Saliva


#### Summary Yuwen He
**Value of Viral Nucleic Acid in Sputum and Feces and Specific IgM/IgG in Serum for the Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019**

##### Methods
* Participants: 
  * "20 patients in this hospital who were almost critically ill or severe, other mild or asymptomatic patients were not admitted. The subjects of our study were all COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital, and there were no additional inclusion or exclusion criteria."
  * " The median time from onset to admission to our hospital for 20 patients was 9.5 (7.5–14.0), some patients had been treated elsewhere during this period. And the median hospital stay was 63.5 (28.0–93.8) days."
* Sampling: "After admission, the patient was tested for viral nucleic acid continuously for a week and then every 2–3 days. Antibodies have been tested every 2–3 days since 15 February. To improve the efficiency of clinical work, collection of long-lasting negative specimens was suspended, while positive specimens were continuously collected until discharge."
* Serology: 
  * "Our serological test used for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM/IgG antibodies was a rapid detection method. The detection principle of the IgM/IgG antibody detection kit (Livzon Diagnostics Co., Ltd, Zhuhai, China) for SARS-CoV-2 is based on colloidal gold immunochromatography."
  * "The clinical test results of this kit showed that the detection sensitivity of IgM was 79.0% and the specificity was 99.7%; the detection sensitivity of IgG was 84.3% and the specificity was 99.4%; the combined detection sensitivity of IgM and IgG was 90.6% and the specificity was 99.2%."

##### Results
* Figure 1 shows the disease progression as time series with the serological and PCR tests done for each patient. 
* "SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in nasal swabs, throat swabs and feces for a small number of patients (patients #10, #14, #17, and #21) were invariably negative from diagnosis to discharge but lasted for 94, 29, 41, and 4 days in sputum, respectively. Moreover, sputum samples remained positive for an average of 42.8 ± 4.2 (mean ± SD) days since diagnosis."
* "The feces samples remained SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive for 22.3 ± 29.8 (mean ± SD) days since diagnosis, of which 11 patients (55%) were positive."
* "Although the existence time of virus in feces was not significantly different from that in nasal or throat swabs (Figure 2), it is worth noting that patients #2 and #8 presented consecutively positive in feces samples for 24.0 and 29.0 days, respectively after the nasal-swab, throat-swab, and sputum samples consistently became negative."

##### Discussion
* "In summary, SARS-CoV-2 has multiple shedding ways and a more prolonged survival period in sputum specimens from COVID-19 patients."

##### Methods
* Participants: 
  * Group In-patients: 44 COVID-19 inpatients.  29 of those 44 had paired samples taken (Table 1). Initial Covid-19 diagnosis at hospital admission by NPS for all patients. 
  * Group Healthcare Workers: 485 asymptomatic healthcare workers (e.g., without fever or respiratory symptoms) with occupational exposure to patients with COVID-19 were enrolled.
* Sample Collection: 
  * saliva: "Saliva samples were self-collected by the patient. Upon waking, patients were asked to avoid food, water and brushing of teeth until the sample was collected. Patients were asked to repeatedly spit into a sterile urine cup until roughly a third full of liquid (excluding bubbles), before securely closing it."
  * NPS: "Nasopharyngeal samples were taken by registered nurses using the BD universal viral transport (UVT) system. The flexible, mini-tip swab was passed through the patient's nostril until the posterior nasopharynx was reached, left in place for several seconds to absorb secretions then slowly removed while rotating."
* Sample Handling: "All samples were stored at room temperature and transported to the research lab at the Yale School of Public Health within 5 hours of sample collection."

  * In-Patients: tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab with CLIA-approved assay
  * "Upon waking, patients were asked to avoid food, water and brushing of teeth until the sample was collected. Patients were asked to repeatedly spit into a sterile urine cup until roughly a third full of liquid (excluding bubbles), before securely closing it. All samples were stored at room temperature and transported to the research lab at the Yale School of Public Health within 5 hours of sample collection and tested within 12 hours of sample collection."
* Detection limits for SARS-CoV-2 using the US CDC “N1” assay is at cycle threshold 38, which corresponds to 5,610 virus copies/mL 
  
##### Results

__In-patients:__
* __Figure 1 A:__
  * "Using primer sequences from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we detected more SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the saliva specimens (mean log copies per milliliter, 5.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.09 to 6.07) than in the nasopharyngeal swab specimens (mean log copies per milliliter, 4.93; 95% CI, 4.53 to 5.33) (Fig. 1A, and Fig. S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1)." //=> about 4.4 times higher in saliva
  * The viral load in saliva can be as high as 10^10 copies/milliliter.
* __Figure 1 B:__ "At 1 to 5 days after diagnosis, 81% (95% CI, 71 to 96) of the saliva samples were positive, as compared with 71% (95% CI, 67 to 94) of the nasopharyngeal swab specimens." 
* __Figure 1 C and D:__
  * "In three instances, a negative nasopharyngeal swab specimen was followed by a positive swab at the next collection of a specimen (Fig. 1D); this phenomenon occurred only once with the saliva specimens (Fig. 1C)."
  * "During the clinical course, we observed less variation in levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the saliva specimens (standard deviation, 0.98 virus RNA copies per milliliter; 95% credible interval, 0.08 to 1.98) than in the nasopharyngeal swab specimens (standard deviation, 2.01 virus RNA copies per milliliter; 95% credible interval, 1.29 to 2.70) (see Supplementary Appendix 1)."
  * " In specimens collected from in-patients by health care workers, we found greater variation in human RNase P cycle threshold (Ct) values in nasopharyngeal swab specimens (standard deviation, 2.89 Ct; 95% CI, 26.53 to 27.69) than in saliva specimens (standard deviation, 2.49 Ct; 95% CI, 23.35 to 24.35)."

__In-patients compared to Healthcare workers:__
* "In specimens collected from in- patients by health care workers, we found greater variation in human RNase P cycle threshold (Ct) values in nasopharyngeal swab specimens (standard deviation, 2.89 Ct; 95% CI, 26.53 to 27.69) than in saliva specimens (standard deviation, 2.49 Ct; 95% CI, 23.35 to 24.35)."

> An early version of this article with fewer patients has the title "Evaluating the accuracy of different respiratory specimens in the
laboratory diagnosis and monitoring the viral shedding of
2019-nCoV infections"

Location: Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Date: written in May, patients likely from January to March
##### Methods
* Participants: "Four hundred and ten patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the Guangdong CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention), who were hospitalized in Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, were included."
* "3,552 respiratory specimens from 410 patients were serially collected during hospitalization, including 559 oropharyngeal swabs, 2,231 nasopharyngeal swabs, 696 sputum samples, and 66 BALF samples."
* "The different types of specimens from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were stratified into three groups based on the collection times: 0–7, 8–14, and R15 d.a.o."

##### Results

It is observed that NPS have quite a low detection rate (only about 60% for mild cases) and sputum has a high detection rate for both mild and severe cases (about 80%). Detection rates adapted and shortened from Table 1 in the paper:

###### Positive rate (n/N, %) during day 0 - 7 of illness
Specimen      | Severe Cases | Mild Cases
--|--|--
oropharyngeal | 40/55 (72.7) | 84/158 (53.2)
nasopharyngeal| 58/68 (85.3) | 195/314 (62.1)
sputum        | 14/16 (87.5) | 38/46 (82.6)
BALF          | 2/2 (100.0)  | 0/0 (0)

###### Positive rate (n/N, %) during day 8 - 14
Specimen      | Severe Cases | Mild Cases
--|--|--
oropharyngeal | 39/81 (48.1) | 48/105 (45.7)
nasopharyngeal| 117/170(68.8)| 241/454 (53.1) 
sputum        | 29/39 (74.4) | 80/109 (73.4)
BALF          | 13/13 (100)  | 0/2 (0)

###### Ct values (median, range) during day 0 - 7
Specimen      | Severe Cases | Mild Cases
--|--|--
oropharyngeal | 29.5 (18-36) | 29.5 (15-37)
nasopharyngeal| 29.3 (19-38) | 29 (15-38)
sputum        | 26 (19-32)   | 28 (18-38)
BALF          | 22.5 (21-24) | -


* Table 1 
* Figure 2 shows time series of viral loads for a series 21 individuals (18 severe and 3 mild patients). The detection rates vary for different time points, for different patients and for different locations:
  * While *no* viral RNA was detected in the upper respiratory tract, at the *same* time it was positive in BALF for the cases 01, 03, 07, 11, 12, 13, and 16 (Figure 2).  
  * "Viral RNA was tested negative in the first three or all of the upper respiratory samples. However, viral RNA was detected either by the further detection of upper respiratory samples (cases 21–28) or BALF samples (cases 02, 04, 06, and 07) (Figures 2 and S1)."
* Figure 3 shows CT Scans of the mentioned 11 cases (02, 04, 06, 07 and 21-28) tested negative at least 3 time in the upper respiratory tract. The CT  show typical ground-glass opacity in the lungs, suggesting a viral pneumonia.

### Viral Load Series in URT

#### Summary Yilmaz
**Upper Respiratory Tract Levels of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RNA and Duration of Viral RNA Shedding Do Not Differ Between Patients With Mild and Severe/Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019**
##### Methods
* "We collected serial upper respiratory tract samples (1 nasopharyngeal swab and 1 throat swab put in a single collection tube with 1 mL of transport medium) for real-time PCR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for all patients."
* " Severe/critical patients were defined as those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen and mild as those not requiring supplementary oxygen or hospitalization."
* "Viral load, expressed as log10 of viral RNA per swab, was calculated as (47 – observed cycle threshold value) / 3.4. This formula applies the average of the parameters (slope and constant) that we observe when we quantify viruses in serum using quantitative PCR with serial dilution of quantification standards (plasmid carrying target sequence) and presumes a 10-μL sample volume in the reaction and a 97% efficiency in the PCR." 
##### Results
* "The highest viral loads were observed early after onset of symptoms in both groups of participants (Figure 1A and 1B). At 7 days, mean viral load among virus-positive patients was 5.8 log10 copies/swab for those with mild disease (n = 37) and 5.5 log10 copies/swab for those with severe/critical disease (n = 12) (P = .53). At 14 days, mean viral load was 4.4 log10 copies/swab for those with mild disease (n = 38) and 4.2 log10 copies/swab for those with severe/critical disease (n = 14) (P = .56)."
* "The median duration of viral RNA shedding was 24.0 days in patients with mild disease and 22.5 days in patients with severe/critical disease (Figure 1C)."
* "We recorded clinical symptoms for 34 of the 39 participants with mild disease. Follow-up was done by regular phone calls. The most common presenting symptom was cough and fever, both occurring in 27 of 34 participants (79%), followed by muscle pain in 22 (65%), rhinitis in 20 (59%), and sore throat in 16 (47%)."


#### Summary Zhou
**SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Upper Respiratory Specimens of Infected Patients**
##### Methods
"We analyzed the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients in relation to day of onset of any symptoms (Fig. 1C)." 
##### Results
* "Higher viral loads (inversely related to Ct value) were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat." 
* "Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza[4] and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV."
* "The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients." //not necessarily the lower respiratory tract is likely more relevant for spread
* For many patients the time series of their nasal and throat swabs are varying and don't have single local maxima but several. The viral load can even be undetectable one day and be positive the next day. //=> to exclude infection several negative samples are needed.



### Timing Specimen Collection

#### Summary Carlson-Jones
**The microbial abundance dynamics of the paediatric oral cavity before and after sleep**
##### Methods 
"Using flow cytometry, bacterial and virus-like particle (VLP) abundances were enumerated for 6 oral microhabitats before and after sleep in 10 healthy paediatric sleepers."
##### Results
* Both bacteria and viral like particles live in micro habitats in the mouth. The habitats are more connected before sleep than after sleep (which is expected due the reduced saliva flow at night).  Shown in Figure 8. 
* During sleep there about a 4 to 10 fold increase in *viral particles* in the mouth (shown in Table 2). E.g. 
  * at the back of the tongue from 2.2 * 10 ^ 7 to 9.2 * 10 ^ 7 
  * at the posterior buccal vestibule from 5.7 * 10^6 to 5.7 * 10^7
* During sleep there about a 3 to 6 fold increase in *bacteria* in the mouth (shown in Table 1). E.g. 
  * at the back of the tongue from 2.9 * 10 ^ 7 to 1.3 * 10 ^ 8 
* The viral like particles are more homogenously distributed throughout the habitats than the bacteria (Table 1 and Table 2):
  * VLPs: maximal a 12 fold difference before sleep, max 6 fold diff after sleep
  * Bacteria: maximal a 40 fold difference before sleep, max 30 fold diff after sleep


#### Summary Dawes
**Salivary flow patterns and the health of hard and soft oral tissues**
* "The salivary flow rate is influenced by a large number of factors, including the degree of hydration, body position, exposure to light, previous stimulation, circadian and circannual rhythms, gland size and drug use.(7)"
  * "During sleep, the salivary flow rate is negligible.(8)"
  * "The unstimulated flow rate averages 0.3 to 0.4 milliliter per minute, but the range is wide."
  * "With gum chewing, the flow rate peaks at about 6 mL/minute in the first minute."
  * "However, Watanabe and Dawes (12) found that when subjects ate several foods, the mean flow rates during chewing varied between 3.15 and 4.94 mL/minute, while infusion of 5 per- cent citric acid into the mouth elicited a flow rate of 7.07 mL/minute. Taste stimulation is a much more effective salivary stimulus than is chewing alone.(13)"
* "Because saliva from the various glands enters the mouth at several locations, it is not well-mixed. The enzyme amylase is secreted primarily by the parotid glands, and, by using amylase as a marker for parotid saliva, Sas and Dawes (5). 
* "When flow is unstimulated, the parotid, sub- mandibular, sublingual and minor mucous glands (MMGs) contribute about 25 percent, 60 percent, 7 to 8 percent and 7 to 8 percent, respectively, to whole saliva, but when flow is stimulated, the parotid glands’ contribution increases by at least 10 percent."

**Early-Morning vs Spot Posterior Oropharyngeal Saliva for Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Implication of Timing of Specimen Collection for Community-Wide Screening**
##### Methods 
* "Posterior oropharyngeal saliva was collected at 5 different time points within the same day from 18 patients with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by molecular testing. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared."
* "The 5 specific time points were (1) early-morning (first thing in the morning upon awakening, before teeth brushing, mouth rinsing, and eating breakfast); (2) before lunch; (3) before afternoon tea at 3 pm; (4) before dinner; and (5) before bedtime (and before teeth brushing). Patients were not asked to refrain from eating, drinking, or mouth rinsing before collection of posterior oropharyngeal saliva at the second, third, and fourth time points to resemble spot saliva taken at the clinic in real life."
##### Results
* "There was an overall trend of lower Ct values from specimens collected in the early morning, with a gradual decrease of viral load towards nighttime, but reaching statistical significance only when compared with the specimens collected at bedtime. Eight out of 13 subjects had a higher viral load in the early morning than the rest of the 4 time points (before lunch, before teatime at 3 pm, before dinner, before bedtime)."
* "The distribution of Ct values at 5 different time points is shown in Figure 1. The medians (IQRs) at early morning, before lunch, before teatime at 3 pm, before dinner, and before bedtime were 34.5 (32.5–41), 38.2 (33.9–41), 36.3 (34.5–41), 41 (34.7–41), and 41 (34.7–41), respectively."

## Appendix

### Calculation of Viral Load from CT_Value
`viral_load = d_c_h / 2^CT_cycles` where `d_c_h = detection_limit_for_helper_method` (the helper method detects when a certain concentration of DNA or RNA is reached, often optical fluorescence is used)
For calculations taken logarithms is helpful. For logarithm to base 2:
`log2(viral_load) = log2(d_c_h) - CT_cycles`
The viral load as logarithm to base 10:
`log10(viral_load) =log2(viral_load)/log2(10) = (log2(d_c_h) - CT_cycles)/3.32`
Detection limit:
`PCR_detection_limit * 2^max_cycles = helper_method_detection_limit`

An example formula for their apparatus is in [Yilmaz et al](#summary-yilmaz).
