## Infection Tropism and Disease Patterns 
**[in work]**

### Abstract Disease Patterns
Coronaviruses cause infections at different locations and thus induce different diseases: 
* The human endemic coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, NL63 and E229) cause mainly upper respiratory tract infections.
* The coronaviruses directly emerging from zoonoses MERS-CoV and Sars-CoV-1 cause lower respiratory tract infections and frequently spread to the intestine. 

In the case of bovine coronaviruses it is known that the same strains show different tropisms depending on the outbreak. So different that the infections are recognized as different diseases and until the 90's it hasn't even been clear that both are cause by the same coronavirus since they occur often independent:
* Enteric disease (neonatal calf diarrhea, winter dysentery) 
* Respiratory disease (shipping fever and general pneumonia). 

Similarly to the bovine coronavirus, the human coronavirus NL63, which usually causes only common colds, from time to time is involved in an outbreak cascade of lower respiratory tract infections. E.g. observed in old care homes [citation in work].

For Sars-CoV-2 too, different infection patterns are observed:  Virulent lower respiratory tract infections, similar to Sars-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV and more subtle upper respiratory tract infections similar to the human endemic coronaviruses. These yields the question how these infection are related and under which circumstance which infection pattern occurs:
* What drives and causes the different infection location patterns?
* How to prevent and treat depending on locations?
* Which are complications and risks?
* What immune protections are raised under which circumstances. 

Regarding these questions the following hypotheses are state and argued:
* Coronavirus can induce distinct infection patterns 
* The infection patterns are the result of and can be predicted by the factors:
    - the virus strain
    - the history of the initial virion[s] i.e. the cell and location they got produced and the physical, chemical and biological factors they have been exposed on their travel
    - the initial infection location
    - the host immune system and its experience with the virus strain
* The pathogenesis, possible complications and the optimal treatment depend on the infection patterns. 


### Infections caused by Human Coronaviruses

##### Abbreviations
- LRI = lower respiratory infection
- URI = upper respiratory infection
- EI = enteric infection

Infection Type| Coronavirus  | Symptoms | Immune_response | possible Complications | Infection Path | Notes
--------------|--------------|----------|---------------|------------------------|---------------|----
URI | NL63, OC43, HKU1, E229, Sars-CoV-2  | Sore throat, upper cough, sneezing | often local T cells (Tissue resident T cells) which can migrate and protect the lungs, IgA antibodies |  LRI, possibly longer lasting infection, local spread | droplet, aerosol | Immune system in the pharynx is used to viruses => milder symptoms and viruses need capabilities to evade/hide.
LRI | MERS-CoV, Sars-CoV-1, Sars-CoV-2, (NL63), (OC43) | shortness of breath, fever, dry cough | local T cells if available and/else IgG antibodies, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, viraemia which can cause death, EI| aerosol, dry form | transmission increases when much air is shared; the lung surface is big => lots of space to spread
EI  | Sars-CoV-1, (Sars-CoV-2), MERS-CoV| diarrhea|  specific immune cells, some of them capable of producing antibodies | - | through viraemia, through alimentary either by URI/LRI infections since the respiratory fluids are cleared to the stomach; direct oral intake | Adequate immune response, direct oral infection unlikely since the stomach acid destroys most virions 

* The coronaviruses directly emerging from zoonoses from outdoor living animals MERS-CoV and likely  Sars-CoV-1 cause mainly LRI and spread to the intestine. In wild animals this is the [way to spread and survive](#life-cycle-of-a-coronavirus-entity). 
* The coronaviruses well adapted to our 'modern' way of life with dense population and in indoor rooms mainly infect to upper respiratory tract and ignore the intestine. 

> ### On the Origin
> The origin of Sars-CoV-1 is unclear: Related viruses are found in bats and even more similar in civet cats. However seroprevalence of antibodies in civet cats suggest that Sars-CoV-1 is not endemic to civet cats and thus there was a jump to civet cats around the same time (2002) when Sars-CoV-1 jumped to humans.
>
> The origin of Sars-CoV-2 is unknown. Considering its tropism, animal farming origin with frequent and even persistent infections of farmers seems possible. Goats or sheep could be the hosts of the Sars-2 viruses, possibly even of Sars-like in general. That Sars-CoV-2 was discovered  in a live-animal-market goes in line or a least is no contradiction with a farming origin: Rare severe cases in rural areas may not have rung the bells. However severe lung disease cases connected to a live-animal-market, triggered thorough investigations resulting in the discovery of Sars-CoV-2. The capable virology research facility in Wuhan may have sped the discovery.
> 
> Virus discovery is not easy and requires the right settings. Some of the settings often need to be guessed since the virus in question are unknown. The human coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63 have been discovered only in 2004/5 despite both being endemic to human for a long time and virologists had the (theoretical) possibilities to discover coronaviruses since the 70's. MERS got discovered in 2012 but likely human infections have occurred long before.

### Infection Locations and Immune Responses
[in work and partly **estimated/guessed**, citations coming/in search]

Infection Type  | Location | Symptoms | Immune responses | Comments and Risks/ possible complications/internal  spread  | Infection Path |
----|----|----|----|----|----
URI| Nose (nasal cavity / nasopharynx)| sneezing, loss of smell, headache, red eyes (especially if mask open towards the eyes)  |runny nose (mucus), local T cells or antibodies |  LRI, local spread| aerosol
URI| Mouth (oropharynx) | loss of taste | local T cells|  (LRI), (spread through olfactory route could occur)| droplet, direct contact, (indirect contact)
URI| Throat (laryngopharynx) |sore throat, upper cough | inflammation, local T cells|  LRI| droplet, aerosol
LRI | bronchi | strange feeling in the lungs, shortness of breath, fever, dry cough | antibodies, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, distribution throughout the lungs, (viraemia)| fine aerosol, dry form 
LRI | alveoli | strange feeling in the lungs, shortness of breath, fever, feeling sick | antibodies, fever, inflammation of lung areas | ARDS which can cause death, viraemia which can cause death and spread to many organs| fine aerosol, dry form 



#### Not Infectable Locations
Not infectable since no ACE2 and thus the symptoms from the corresponding location indicate an **agent other** than Sars-2

Infection Type  | Location | Symptoms | Immune response | Comments and Risks/ possible complications | Notes
--------------|--------------|----------|---------------|------------------------|---------------
MRI| Vocal folds | hoarse | - | no ACE2 cells thus no virus replication |
LRI | trachea | cough  | irritation due to virions deposited| [no ACE2 cells](.../1_biological/coronavirus.md#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2) thus no replication| viral load in sputum due to deposition
