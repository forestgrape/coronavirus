## Mask Usage
* For self protection, a good fit and a good outside-to-inside filter are important.  
* In indoor rooms with aerosol transmission:
  * frequent [changing/cleaning the masks](#mask-reuse-and-cleaning) is necessary to prevent the spread of aerosols, especially for [low and mid filtration masks](#filter-performance)
  * [high filtration masks](#high-filtration) are needed to reliably filter aerosols
* After coughing or sneezing into mask changing is needed (one should *not cough into a mask* but cough into the hand/handkerchief and downwards, then the hand should be washed or disinfected; moreover with heavy cough and without a negative Covid test, ideally one is out of public spaces). After speaking a lot into a mask, changing is appropriate. Especially for [low and mid filter models](#filter-performance).
* To avoid person to person droplet transmission e.g. when speaking, wearing in close distance face-to-face situations is necessary.
* Some mask have a big air resistance combined with a loose fit, in that case the air bypasses the mask. These are like wearable plexiglas: There's still protection against droplets, but the bypassed air contains [aerosol](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#aerosol). 



## Mask Effectiveness

> **Reduction upon exhalation is likely low for many masks** (especially if the mask is used long without changing what many do). Reasons:
> * Most lab experiments are done with fresh masks and not with masks used for several hours.
> * The effectiveness is likely better for inhalation than for exhalation:
   The air is exhaled often at higher speeds than inhaled and the air exhaled is directed => higher air pressure difference upon exhalation on the filter (The filter performance in turn decreases with higher pressure differences).
> * long worn (cloths) mask could have a **spray effect for the aerosol** spread: accumulation of exhaled breadth condensate in the inner side/layers of the mask and then spray like release upon strong exhales such as shouting.

* [Milton et al.](#milton2013) measured the influenza viruses spread from patients with and without wearing a surgical mask. They found:
    - Particles greater than 5 micro meter: Surgical masks nearly eliminated viral RNA detection in the coarse aerosol fraction: resulting in a 25 fold reduction in the number of viral copies 
    - Particles smaller than 5 micro meter:  statistically significant 2.8 fold reduction in viral copies detected in the fine aerosol fraction.
    - Overall: Surgical masks significantly reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold.
    
   
    Assuming a reduction of exhaled particles by a factor of 2 (50% reduction) and a reduction by a factor 2 (50% reduction) for inhaling: everybody wearing a mask yields a total reduction factor of 4 = (2 times fewer particles inhaled) * (2 times fewer particles in the air since fewer exhaled) for aerosol transmission. This can yield a significant reduction of transmission in public indoor rooms (e.g. Supermarkets or Public Transport). 
    
    <!--This would be a greater reduction in the reproduction factor than  observed for other measures. A factor 5 reduction would be enough to reduce the reproduction factor below 1 if an initial value of 4 is estimated (an estimate from the imperial college in London by Ferguson, Bhatt et al](#ferguson-bhatt).[in work]-->


## Mask Types
Mask can be classified either by
* [Filter Performance](#filter-performance) How good is the filter?
* [Usage Classes](#usage-classes) What is the intended usage?


### Filter Performance
The filtration performance specifies how much and which particles are filtered out of the air at some fixed airflows and pressures. 
There are various standards to classify mask by their filtration quality: E.g. in Europe the FFP norms, in the US N95/P95 (e.g. Wikipedia page on FFP standards). High filtration is the safe option in situations with [aerosol transmission](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#overview-airborne-transmission). 


* #### Very High Filtration
  ##### FFP3

* #### High Filtration
  ##### FFP2
  FFP2 (Europe), N95(US), KN95(China). (Correctly tested & certified) high filtration mask also have a good fit, since if the air sidelines the mask, no aerosols are hold back regardless of the filter (droplets are still hold back). 
  * N95 (United States NIOSH-42CFR84)
  * FFP2 (Europe EN 149-2001)
  * KN95 (China GB2626-2006)
  * P2 (Australia/New Zealand AS/NZA 1716:2012)
  * Korea 1st class (Korea KMOEL - 2017-64)
  * DS2 (Japan JMHLW-Notification 214, 2018)

* #### Intermediate-High Filtration
  ##### FFP1 
  Most models are for [dust protection](#dust-protection-masks). 
* #### Intermediate Filtration
  ##### Surgical Masks

* #### Low-Intermediate Filtration 
  Textile mask often have low filter performance. They prevent the [droplet exchange](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#droplets) when face-to-face talking and offer some self protection regarding aerosols. However, they do not prevent the spread of aerosols, which is important in indoor rooms if possibly infected. Indoors where aerosol transmission is likely low filtration masks shouldn't be used to protect others. 

### Usage Classes
* #### Dust Protection Masks
  _Protection masks_ against dust are constructed for outside-in protection and therefore good for self protection. Sometimes they have valves which let out the air unfiltered i.e. no inside to outside filtration protection. Thus masks with valves offer protection for the wearer only and *not* for others. Dust mask exists for all mid to very high filter classes including all FFP filter classes. The fit is usually good and the comfort ok.
* #### Medical masks
  There are two types of medical mask. 
  * ##### Surgical Masks
    _Surgical masks_ are constructed for comfort and the focus is on inside to outside droplet protection (during surgery, the body is open and so there is no skin protection). Mainly larger particles such as bacteria are filtered. They cover the entire mouth area to prevent  nutrition rests or face hairs falling down. Usually they are very flat and don't look muzzle like which is bad since the air pressure isn't evenly distributed across the filter especially when mouth breathing/talking (the pressure peaks before the mouth and much of the airflow then gets a sideway momentum). 
  * ##### Medical protections masks 
    _Medical protections masks_ are constructed to protect medical staff against pathogens from infected patients. These masks are usually in a high [filtration category](#filter-performance) such as FFP2 and offer good protection for all pathogens including viruses.
* #### Textile Masks
  _Textile masks_ or _Community masks_ are available in a lot of sizes and styles. A model with fitting comfort and style is usually available. The [filtration performance](#filter-performance) is often [low](#low-filtration). The [droplet spread](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#overview-airborne-transmission) is prevented but how relevant the droplet spread is, is unclear. 


## Mask Reuse and Cleaning

### Cleaning Methods
The coronaviruses virions are not very stable especially if exposed to disinfectants, sunlight, soap and temperatures above 45 degrees (-> [Page Virion Viability](../2_biological/virion_viability.md)). So making a mask 'coronavirus clean' is easy:

* __wash__: wash with soap/hot water/machine-wash.
* __heat__: heat to around 70 degrees for 20 minutes e.g. hot water, steam or in the oven - all measures which have been scientifically proven to destroy the Sars-CoV-2 viruses and leave the mask intact [citation coming] [Chan et al.](#chan) have shown that Sars-CoV-1 is inactivated above 50 degrees.
* __sunlight__: if washing or heating is not available (e.g. water saving in dry areas or camping), putting the mask to the bright sunlight is an alternative in areas with intense sunlight.
* __disinfect__: spray with *pure* alcohol (*not* alcohol with additives which some cleaning products have). Other disinfectants are not recommended since they may have health hazards if inhaled.
* __waiting__: Usually half of the virions decay during several hours at room temperature (i.e. the halflife time is several hours). Thus the next day (or even better a few days) most virions are not infectious anymore.

### Reasons for Clean Masks
The [mask effectiveness](#mask-effectiveness) is usually evaluated with fresh masks and not with mask worn for several hours. The problem if the mask is continuously worn for several hours is, that virions can be slowly breathed through the filter, which occurs more at exhalation than inhalation ([mask effectiveness](#mask-effectiveness)). Therefore masks should regularly be changed or [cleaned](#mask-reuse-and-cleaning). Even rotating a bunch masks through each day and reusing them the next day helps. Wearing the same mask as short as doable especially if its about protecting others.

### Mask Recommendation
> written in Spring 2020 and left for historical reasons.

Officially recommend masks for spread reduction in indoor rooms. Without an official recommendation, people can be put off or look afraid of masks, at least [were] in Europe, which is not desirable, since masks are protective.

Reasons against masks seem sometimes rather searched:
* touching more often the face. 
  > Infection is not possible by touching the skin alone, this is true for the skin in the face too. Touching into the mouth or the nose is something else, but for this, masks are protective. 
* Reserve for healthcare workers is needed for the big wave. 
  > If masks help to prevent the big wave in its roots, then that's the better option.

## Appendix: Personal Mask Preferences

### Tips & Tricks
* Carefully rounding the wire above the nose helps to reduce the airstream to the eyes.
* Putting the masks a couple of hours to the fresh air before wearing reduces smells. Fabric smells can indicate volatile substances which may not be healthy to inhale (although I don't think these substance are any more hazardous than other substances we are daily exposed e.g. micro-plastic from car wires).
* FFP1 masks of fold type and surgical masks to my experience become more comfortable with use since they loose their stiffness. As noted mask shouldn't be continuously over many hours; better to switch masks and [reuse the next day](#mask-reuse-and-cleaning).

### Current Mask Preferences
> Currently (winter 20/21 and spring 2021) 
> * For day to day use (less than half an hour e.g. supermarket). I mainly use FFP1 masks of fold type, currently the model CX9501 (made by Jiangsu Sanfo Outdoor Products Co, Suqian, Jiangsu, China and sold for about 1$ at Migros). This mask has some foam protection above the nose which prevents an airstream into the eyes and provides comfort. Also behind-the-head clips are supplemented. The masks have a fabric when opened, open ahead of usage helps. Sometimes I also use surgical masks for day to day use.
> * For longer time periods (more than about half an hour e.g. during train travel): I mainly use FFP 1 dust protection masks (3M 8710 E made in Wroclaw PL; about 1$ a piece). The filtration requirements for FFP1 masks is less than FFP2 masks but stricter than surgical masks. To my judgement the 3M 8710 E model does protect others from very fine aerosol as good as FFP2 models. Nevertheless I recommend FFP2 models if infected (tested or strong evidence) if transmission opportunities can't be avoided.
__Advantages__: As for most dust protection masks, the fit is dense due to bands behind the head. They wear about as (un)comfortable as ski googles: tight but ok. Breathing is easy and there's no sidelined air into the eyes.
__Drawbacks__: Taken on/off is cumbersome, for short time usage I prefer surgical masks. As most dust protections masks, the 8710 E don't look fashionable.

 
> [Dense] masks are less important if cases go towards zero (e.g. in summer). But there are also good reasons to continue using masks in certain indoor public spaces (e.g. large shopping centers, crowded public transport, airplanes). Not necessarily in facultative places (e.g. offices or libraries) and probably not a general mandate since there are miles between going to the next door shop/office and taking some international flight. One reason is, masks also reduce the spread of the other respiratory diseases: 
> * When mainly SARS-2 is around causing cough, it is much easier to detect outbreaks and take adequate precaution steps upon infection.
> * Respiratory pathogens are sometimes underestimated so reducing the circulating strains, is a nice [side] effect.


> Considering infections with other viruses and since both a past infection and vaccination seem unlikely to provide a reliable future proof protection against transmissions, there is no reason to make masks exceptions when it's about protecting others (However past infections reliably prevent severe Covid and vaccination also do a good job at preventing severe Covid).


### Personal Mask History
> 1. Started with FFP2 dust protection masks from a hardware store. Even though they weren't made from cloth they felt like. Officially these masks weren't washable but hand-washing with soap worked. The masks had a dense fit. However, the fit came at the cost of a reduced comfort: very tight bands around the head and not really comfortable at the nose. // I am not sure anymore if these were good masks, a very similar/even the same model was shown to have incorrect declarations and to fail the specifications. Also a direct  (subjective and not scientific) comparison to the FFP2 masks of 2021, the 2021 models seem to have the better filters.
> 2. In summer 2020 I bought some cloth mask but I didn't like the fit since there was no fixation above the nose. I went to the hardware store to get some other dust FFP2s, however these were sold out but instead they had cloth masks. These had a good fit and were comfortable and I used them during summer.
> 3. In autumn when (evidence for) aerosol transmission increased combined with reports that many cloth mask were not dense enough, I went on to surgical masks. There are differences between the models of surgical masks: some are easier to breath through while others more air sidelines by the nose/eyes, which can be distracting.
> 4. Over the winter I tried different 'Covid edition' FFP2s. The bands usually went around the ears and so the fit was not very tight. The loose fit combined with dense filters sometimes produces purpose defeating and uncomfortable sidelined air. But usually no more than surgical masks, so overall the protection from FFP1 masks is better.
> 5. Around christmas time I went once again to a hardware store to buy some dust FFP2. Sold out FFP2 dust masks again, but dust FFP1 were available. They fit and are in use since then(Introduction statement).
> 6. In spring 2021 I started using FFP1 masks of fold type. They are widely available to ok prices (about 1$/SFR/Euro) and the breathing ability is good by now.
