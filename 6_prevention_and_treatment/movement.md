## Summary 
Movement has many health benefits including increased resistance against symptomatic and severe respiratory infections. Movement is also helpful in the early phase of Covid-19 helps to produce a good immune response. In the convalescent phase movement speeds up recovery and reduces the probability of long term effects.

During a Covid only adequate and **moderate movement** (e.g. a walk) and **not** intense exercise is recommended. Exercise during Covid has risks such as heart muscles inflammations.

> In many countries it is not allowed leaving the private ground upon infection. Circumvention: owning/buying a large garden and owning/building a personal fitness studio (importantly with a built in ventilation unless used alone!). Also commented in [in the movement summary on the Covid19 page](../3_medical/covid19.md#quarantine-movement-contradiction).

## Relevance
To support good health and Covid prognosis the [measures](../7_social/controlling.md) and the [isolation and quarantine rules](../7_social/controlling.md#covid-19-cases-and-quarantine)) should take the benefits of movement into account.

## Movement to Increase Health and Resistance to Respiratory Infections
Movement ahead of an infection increases the overall fitness level. 

### Literature on Movement during Covid Times
 Since exercise involves movement, some citations are about exercise but often the findings hold for any form of movement. 
* In his readable interview [Zhu](#zhu) asks precise question to Dr. Woods about the effects of exercising on virus infections and the immune response.
* [Ali and Kunugi](#ali) describe several adverse consequences of reduced/no movement.
* Movement and adequate exercise is recommended in many [recommendations regarding rehabilitation](../3_medical/covid19.md#references-rehabilitation). 

### Biological Mechanisms

## Biological Mechanisms
> [simplified, a more detailed argumentation to be done]

> While the focus is on SARS-CoV-2 many mechanisms generalize to other virus infections.

> Only light movement is recommended. Intense movement is discourage due to various risks such as heart muscle inflammations.

### Early Phase of Covid-19
One reason movement is important in the early phase of Covid, is that the circulation of the lymph is better since the circulation is partly passive and driven by body movement [to confirm and cite]. With movement the virus 'signatures' reach the lymph nodes faster where capable immune cells can be recruited. Some of these cells migrate to protect other body locations: e.g. when infected in the upper respiratory tract some cells migrate to protect lower the lungs. Extern movement makes them migrate faster. With healthy movement, for infections starting in the upper respiratory tract, protective immune cells (mainly T cells) are likely to reach the lungs before the viruses have time to replicate to high numbers.

### Convalescent Phase of Covid-19
In the convalescent phase movement is important since 
1. Movement helps clearing the lymph and thus remnants of SARS-2 (antigens which can cause inflammation) are removed.
2. Movement or even careful sport keep the immune system in check and prevent it from overshooting which is likely a major reason for [long covid](./../3_medical/covid19.md#long-lasting-effects).


## Epidemiological Evidence

### Epidemiological Evidence Movement is Beneficial
There is epidemiological evidence supporting the above argumentation:
* Countless athletes have caught Covid infections. Despite their fitness is thoroughly supervised and regularly competitively evaluated so that even a slight performance decrease is noticed - to my knowledge - no long term effects have been observed. Besides having a good health, adequate training likely helped to overcome Covid.
  > In 2021, sporadic cases of sportives with longer lasting effects or effects on their performance have been published. This effects could be associated to mRNA vaccinations which mess around with the immune system.

* Important risk factors for severe Covid are well correlated with with few movements/sports e.g. obesity, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. Since behavior patters are often stable, it is possible that too few movement/sports is to some extent a confounding cause for the mentioned risk factors.

* [Bielik et al](#bielik) observe that physically active people are about two times as likely to experience a SARS-CoV-2 infection as asymptomatic compared to less active controls. When additional to physical activity, cold water swimming is practiced to chance of being asymptomatic is even higher. Furthermore the cold water swimmers often have about double the chance to have *no* acute respiratory infection in a year. //all results shown in Table 3 in the paper.

* [de Souza et al](#de-souza) Performing at least 150 min of moderate or 75 min intense  physical activity per week reduces the probability of hospitalization by about a third. The reduction is about 35% and significant with 0.028 even when adjusted for age, sex and BMI (Results are shown in Table 3 in the paper). Spending more than 4.7 hours a day sitting increases the hospitalization rate by about 30%.

* [Yates et al](#yates) find that the risk for severe Covid and death is lowered for people with a self reported brisk walking speed. Overweight and obesity also increase the risk for severe Covid and especially for death. //Fig. 1 in the paper

* [Rowlands et al](#rowlands) find that increased physical activity measured by accelerometers during 2013 - 2015 is associated to less severe Covid is especially for women. The chances to catch Covid are more or less the same. // Odds ratios are visualized in Figure S2 and S3 with adjustments and in Figure S4 for unadjusted models.


### Epidemiological Evidence that NO Movement is Bad
* In situations with strict stay-at-home orders the fatality rate (fatality rates in different locations shown in Table 4 in [Ioannidis](../3_medical/covid19.md#ioannidis) including rates for those younger than 70) and the rates of severe cases are higher than in situations without stay-at-home orders (isolation rules can be mostly ignored, especially in spring 2020 since the case detection rates were below 5 %). [more precise analyses on todo]
* Long Covid seems to be nearly exclusively observed in countries with strict quarantine rules. E.g. in Africa seroprevalence observed in late 2020 was often symptom associated, not even during the infection ([Spread Analysis Covid in Africa](./../5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#(#transmissions-in-africa))).
