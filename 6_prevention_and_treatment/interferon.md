##### Methods
"A total of 1401 patients were enrolled, with 852 (60.8%) patients receiving 5 000 000 U of IFN-α-2b via aerosol inhalation twice daily." 
##### Outcome
"The primary outcome was a composite measure consisting of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death."
##### Setting
"The median time from symptom onset to IFN-α-2b treatment was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3–7 days)."
##### Results
"The risk probability for crude endpoints was lower in the IFN-α-2b group (3.8%) than in the non-IFN-α-2b group (9.3%, P < .001). After adjusting the confounding factors, IFN-α-2b therapy achieved a reduction of 64% in occurrence of endpoint events (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–0.62)."

Outcomes:
Outcome\Model | crude | adjusted | 
--|--|--
Composite endpoints | 0.39 (0.25– 0.61) | 0.36 (0.21–0.62)

ICU admission | 0.36 (0.22–0.60) | 0.41 (0.22–0.75)

##### Methods
* uncontrolled, exploratory study, 
* 77 adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were assigned to treatments as follows: 
  * 7 persons: nebulized IFN-α2b (5 mU b.i.d.)
  * 46 persons: arbidol (200mg t.i.d.)
  * 24 persons: combination of IFN-α2b plus arbidol.
##### Results
"Treatment with IFN-α2b with or without arbidol significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and in parallel reduced duration of elevated blood levels for the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP."

Monk PD, Marsden RJ, Tear VJ, Brookes J, Batten TN, Mankowski M, Gabbay FJ, Davies DE, Holgate ST, Ho LP, Clark T. Safety and efficacy of inhaled nebulised interferon beta-1a (SNG001) for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. 2021 Feb 1;9(2):196-206

##### Methods
* "We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial at nine UK sites. Adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, with a positive RT-PCR or point-of-care test, or both, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SNG001 (6 MIU) or placebo by inhalation via a mouthpiece daily for 14 days."
* *Founding:* Synairgen Research
* *Treatment:* "SNG001 (6 MIU interferon beta-1a) or placebo were delivered via the I-neb nebuliser (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA) once daily for up to 14 days (appendix p 4)."
##### Outcome
"The OSCI is a 9-point scale, where 0 corresponds to no infection and 8 corresponds to death."
##### Setting
"66 (67%) patients required oxygen supplementation at baseline: 29 in the placebo group and 37 in the SNG001 group."
##### Results
Outcome\Group | IFN beta-1a (48)| control (49)
--|--|-- 
Recover on Day 14 | 21(44%) | 11(22%)
Recover on Day 28 | 28 (58%) | 17 (35%)
Severe disease on Day 16 (OSCI>=5)| 6 (13%) | 11 (22%)
Deaths | 0 of 48 | 3 of 49


##### Adverse Events
"SNG001 was well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (seven [15%] patients in the SNG001 group and five [10%] in the placebo group). There were three deaths in the placebo group and none in the SNG001 group."
##### Comments
" The optimal route and specific type of interferon might depend on the stage of disease, the spread of viral infection beyond the lung, and the ease of administration in different clinical settings."

Randomized controlled open label trial on the use of favipiravir combined with inhaled interferon beta-1b in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. International Journal of Infectious Diseases. 2021 Jan 1;102:538-43

##### Methods
"Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of favipiravir with interferon beta-1b by inhalation aerosol or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)."

##### Results
"There were no significant differences in the inflammatory biomarkers at hospital discharge between the two groups; C-reactive protein (p = 0.413), ferritin (p = 0.968), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.259) and interleukin 6 (p = 0.410). There were also no significant differences between the two groups with regards to the overall LOS (7 vs 7 days; p = 0.948), transfers to the ICU (18.2% vs 17.8%; p = 0.960), discharges (65.9% vs 68.9%; p = 0.764) and overall mortality (11.4% vs 13.3%; p = 0.778)."

Peginterferon Lambda-1a for treatment of outpatients with uncomplicated COVID-19: a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Nature communications. 2021 Mar 30;12(1):1-0.

##### Methods
" We conducted a randomized, single-blind, placebo- controlled trial (NCT04331899) in 120 outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 to determine whether a single, 180 mcg subcutaneous dose of Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda) within 72 hours of diagnosis could shorten the duration of viral shedding (primary endpoint) or symptoms (secondary endpoint)."

##### Results
"In both the 60 patients receiving Lambda and 60 receiving placebo, the median time to cessation of viral shedding was 7 days (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 1.19). Symptoms resolved in 8 and 9 days in Lambda and placebo, respectively, and symptom duration did not differ significantly between groups (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.39)."

##### Methods 
"In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned to a single subcutaneous injection of peginterferon lambda 180 μg or placebo within 7 days of symptom onset or first positive swab if asymptomatic."

##### Results
" The decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was greater in those treated with peginterferon lambda than placebo from day 3 onwards, with a difference of 2·42 log copies per mL at day 7 (p=0·0041). By day 7, 24 (80%) participants in the peginterferon lambda group had an undetectable viral load, compared with 19 (63%) in the placebo group (p=0·15). After controlling for baseline viral load, patients in the peginterferon lambda group were more likely to have undetectable virus by day 7 than were those in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 4·12 [95% CI 1·15–16·73; p=0·029)."

##### Adverse Events
"Peginterferon lambda was well tolerated, and adverse events were similar between groups with mild and transient aminotransferase, concentration increases more frequently observed in the peginterferon lambda group."
