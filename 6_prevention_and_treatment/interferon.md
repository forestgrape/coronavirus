#### Summary Yu
Yu J, Lu X, Tong L, Shi X, Ma J, Lv F, Wu J, Pan Q, Yang J, Cao H, Li L. Interferon‐α‐2b Aerosol Inhalation is Associated with Improved Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Coronavirus Disease‐2019. British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. 2021 May 13.

##### Methods
* *Type:* multicentre retrospective
* "A total of 1401 patients were enrolled, with 852 (60.8%) patients receiving 5 000 000 U of IFN-α-2b via aerosol inhalation twice daily."
* *Study Population:* "Patients with COVID-19 who were older than 18 years and without mechanical ventilation on the day of admission from centres in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces between 17 January and 19 February 2020.
* "The onset of COVID-19 was defined as the time when symptoms were first noticed."

##### Treatment 
5 000 000 U of IFN-α-2b via aerosol inhalation twice daily.

##### Treatment Timing
Grouped by time after symptom onset.

##### Outcome
* "The composite endpoint was defined as at least one of the following: (1) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) other organ failure and need for intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and treatment, and (3) death."

##### Setting
It is  a retrospective study and there are differences in the medical characteristics and demographics of the patients across the groups. Examples of uneven grouping (Table 2 and Table S4 in the paper): 
* early treatment onset is associated to younger age (45 years for those at 0 -2 days, 51 years for >=12 days and 49.7 years for the control group)
* 77% of the IFN alpha treatment patients received Lopinavir/ritonavir while only 30.8% (considering that Lopinavir/ritonavir is not very efficient for Covid likely not that relevant [to confirm])

##### Results
"The risk probability for crude endpoints was lower in the IFN-α-2b group (3.8%) than in the non-IFN-α-2b group (9.3%, P < .001). After adjusting the confounding factors, IFN-α-2b therapy achieved a reduction of 64% in occurrence of endpoint events (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–0.62)."


Outcome by time of Treatment start after symptom onset (Data from Table 2 and Table S4 in the paper):

Symptom onset to treatment start|All treated|0 - 2 days|3 - 5 days |6 - 8 days |9 - 11 days|>=12 days |Control
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--
Patients|852|208|279|206|109|50|549
Mechanical ventilation |25|2|8|10|3|2|35
ICU admission          |23|2|6|7|5|3|40
Composite endpoint     |32|2|9|12|6|3|51
Mechanical ventilation in %|2.9%|1.0%|2.9%|4.9%|2.8%|4.0%|6.4%
ICU admission in %         |2.7%|1.0%|2.2%|3.4%|4.6%|6.0%|7.3%
Composite endpoint in %    |3.8%|1.0%|3.2%|5.8%|5.5%|6.0%|9.3%
Reduction Mechanical ventilation |54%|85%|55%|24%|57%|37%|0%
Reduction ICU admission          |63%|87%|70%|53%|37%|18%|0%
Reduction Composite endpoint     |60%|90%|65%|37%|41%|35%|0%

> => Efficacy of treatment is over 80% to 90% if started within the first few days of symptom onset.

##### Methods
* *Type:* uncontrolled, exploratory study
* 77 adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were assigned to treatments as follows: 
  * 7 persons: nebulized IFN-α2b (5 mU b.i.d.)
  * 46 persons: arbidol (200mg t.i.d.)
  * 24 persons: combination of IFN-α2b plus arbidol.
* "Viral clearance was defined as two consecutive negative PCR tests at least 24h apart (5)."
##### Results
"Treatment with IFN-α2b with or without arbidol significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and in parallel reduced duration of elevated blood levels for the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP."

##### Methods
* *Type:* retrospective multicenter cohort study
* *Patients:* 446 COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. 
* "Regarding clinical features at admission, the early and no IFN groups had comparable prevalence of high respiratory rate and low O2 saturation within 24 h of admission, whereas the late IFN group had higher prevalence than both early and no IFN groups."

##### Treatment 
IFN-alpha2b administered to the airway directly via an aerosol nebulizer for roughly 10 days.

##### Treatment Timing
Early start is defined as treatment start within 5 days of hospital admission and late start after 5 days.
O2 Saturation by group:

O2 Saturation\Group | Early IFN | Control | Late IFN
--|--|--|--|
<90% | 9 (4.2)| 14 (6.9) |4 (15.4) 
90–93%| 41 (19)| 35 (17.2) |7 (26.9)
\> 93% |166 (76.9) |155 (76) |15 (57.7)



##### Results
* IFN treatment when started within 5 days of admission reduced the mortality by 80%.
* "After adjusting for gender, age, hypertension, diabetes, O2 saturation at admission, symptom count at admission, and symptom onset to admission >7 days, early IFN therapy was estimated to have adjusted HR of 1.14 (95% CI, 0.93–1.41) for hospital discharge and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.81–1.22) for CT scan improvement in comparison with no IFN therapy, whereas late IFN therapy was estimated to have adjusted HR of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.44–1.08) for hospital discharge and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.32– 0.80) for CT scan improvement in comparison with no IFN therapy (Table 2)." //visualized in Figure 2 in the paper.

Monk PD, Marsden RJ, Tear VJ, Brookes J, Batten TN, Mankowski M, Gabbay FJ, Davies DE, Holgate ST, Ho LP, Clark T. Safety and efficacy of inhaled nebulised interferon beta-1a (SNG001) for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. 2021 Feb 1;9(2):196-206

##### Methods
* "We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial at nine UK sites. Adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, with a positive RT-PCR or point-of-care test, or both, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SNG001 (6 MIU) or placebo by inhalation via a mouthpiece daily for 14 days."
* *Founding:* Synairgen Research

##### Treatment
"SNG001 (6 MIU interferon beta-1a) or placebo were delivered via the I-neb nebuliser (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA) once daily for up to 14 days (appendix p 4)."

##### Treatment Timing
"In our study, patients had a median duration of symptoms of 10 days at recruitment and SNG001 was given daily for 14 days."

##### Outcome
* "The OSCI is a 9-point scale, where 0 corresponds to no infection and 8 corresponds to death."
* *Recovered* is defined as having an unchanged post-baseline OSCI score of 0 or 1
##### Setting
"66 (67%) patients required oxygen supplementation at baseline: 29 in the placebo group and 37 in the SNG001 group."

##### Results
Outcome\Group | IFN beta-1a (48)| control (49)
--|--|-- 
Recover (OSCI<=1) on Day 14 | 21(44%) | 11(22%)
Recover (OSCI<=1) on Day 28 | 28 (58%) | 17 (35%)
Severe disease on Day 16 (OSCI>=5)| 6 (13%) | 11 (22%)
Deaths | 0 of 48 | 3 of 49

* The percentages recovered (OSCI<=1) were from day 3 on much higher in the treatment group (odds ratio mostly above 3 (Figure 2); recovery graph shown in Figure 3).
* The percentages discharged from hospital were (only) marginally higher in the IFN group (Figure 4).

> => 
> * About 50% reduction in severe disease despite the treatment start was quite late with a median symptom duration of 10 days. 
> * The probability to be recovered was about two times higher in the IFN group.


##### Adverse Events
"SNG001 was well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (seven [15%] patients in the SNG001 group and five [10%] in the placebo group). There were three deaths in the placebo group and none in the SNG001 group."
##### Comments
" The optimal route and specific type of interferon might depend on the stage of disease, the spread of viral infection beyond the lung, and the ease of administration in different clinical settings."

Randomized controlled open label trial on the use of favipiravir combined with inhaled interferon beta-1b in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. International Journal of Infectious Diseases. 2021 Jan 1;102:538-43

##### Methods
"Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of favipiravir with interferon beta-1b by inhalation aerosol or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)."

##### Results
"There were no significant differences in the inflammatory biomarkers at hospital discharge between the two groups; C-reactive protein (p = 0.413), ferritin (p = 0.968), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.259) and interleukin 6 (p = 0.410). There were also no significant differences between the two groups with regards to the overall LOS (7 vs 7 days; p = 0.948), transfers to the ICU (18.2% vs 17.8%; p = 0.960), discharges (65.9% vs 68.9%; p = 0.764) and overall mortality (11.4% vs 13.3%; p = 0.778)."

##### Methods
* *Date and Location:* March 23 and May 23 of 2020 in Shanghai
* *Patients:* 40 patients in the intervention group and 40 patient in the treatment group.
* *Type:* Open-label, randomized, clinical trial.

##### Treatment
"In addition, both proteins (5 mg TFF2 plus 2 mg IFN-k) were dissolved in 5 mL sterilized water, and the combination aerosol was delivered to the patient for 20 -30 min by a nasal mask driven by a medical compressed air atomizer (YUWELL, 403M). The aerosol inhalation treatment started from the first day of hospitalization and was administered 6 times every 24 h."

##### Treatment Timing
Patients with peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) was > 94% on room air at screening and moderate pneumonia.

##### Medical Analysis of Treatment Effects
* Plasmas were analyzed for 10 biomarkers (IFN-g, IL-1b, IL- 4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12P70, IL-22, TNF-a) using the Simoa Cor- Plex Human Cytokine Panel 1 kit (Cat No: 85-0329).
* "All recruited patients underwent daily collection of nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, and stool swabs to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT- PCR until discharged from hospital."
* "Lymphocyte subset counting was performed. CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T, and CD16+CD56+natural killer (NK) cells were stained by using BD MultitestTM 6-color TBNK reagent in Trucount tubes and analyzed using the BD FACS-CantoTM II flow cytometer."

##### Outcomes
* "The primary endpoint was the timing to achieve viral RNA negative conversion for SARS-CoV-2 in all three specimens, including nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and stool swabs."
* "The secondary clinical endpoint was the timing when CT imaging improvement was observed, which was mainly based on the size and density reduction of lesions."

##### Results
Both the average time for the primary endpoint negative viral RNA conversion and the secondary endpoint improvement in lung CTs were shorter in the treatment group:

![Fu Trial IFN K effects](img_interferon/fu_f2_small.jpeg)

> => Nearly 50% reduction for the average time to viral clearance, about 25% reduced time for CT improvement and about 25% reduced hospital stay.

Notes:
* On the cytokines the treatment had no much influence except a IFN gamma peak around day 2 was only observed in the control group (Fig 5).
* The T cell counts remained similar (Fig. 4.).

Therapeutic effectiveness of interferon alpha 2b treatment for COVID-19 patient recovery

##### Method
"People with suspected COVID-19 in age 50 or older with or without comorbidities and subjects below age 50 with comorbidities were considered high-risk patient and antiviral treatment initiated directly with LPV/RTV + CQ + IFN-α2b. The asymptomatic close contact subjects began treatment within 48 hours after a positive RT-PCR confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection and received LPV/RTV + CQ + IFN-α2b."

##### Treatment 
* "IFN-α2b human recombinant (Heberon® Alpha R) by intramuscular injection 3 million IU 3 times per week, for 4 weeks"
* "To treat pediatric cases, all drugs were adjusted for age and weight or body surface (i.e. IFN: 100.000 IU/Kg) and use subcutaneous route for IFN-α2b."

##### Findings
"On the cut-off date analyzed in this report, the Cuban Overall CFR was 3.70% and 0.92% for patients treated with IFN alpha-2b."

> => The study indicates a mortality reduction by 75% for an early started IFN alpha 2b treatment.

> The subgroup analyses give some hints in which situations the medication could be useful and in which they could be harmful.

##### Methods
* *Type:* Multicentre (across the world) randomized open label trial of repurposed medicaments.
* "The trial drugs were remdesivir, hydroxychloro- quine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a (given with lopinavir until July 4). The hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens were discon- tinued for futility on, respectively, June 19, July 4, and October 16, 2020."
* The death counts are dominated by results from Asia and Africa (53%) and South America (32%), participants in Europe account for  15% of the deaths.
* The death counts are dominated by patient at serious disease state at entry. Most requiring oxygen or even mechanical ventilation: Most patients already required oxygen at entry: 63% of entry, 67% of deaths; 8% required mechanical at entry, 26% of deaths; 28% of patients without supplemental oxygen accounted for 6.2% of deaths. // Medicaments reducing the viral replication are excepted to be effective when started early.

##### Treatment 
* Interferon: "The regimen for interferon (mainly subcutaneous) was three doses over a period of 6 days (the day of randomization and days 3 and 6) of 44 μg of subcutaneous interferon beta-1a; where intravenous interferon was available, patients receiving high-f low oxygen, ventilation, or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were instead to be given 10 μg intravenously daily for 6 days."

##### Outcome
in-hospital mortality regardless of time point.

##### Results
* IFN treatment when the patients were on ventilation at treatment start: The death rate *increased* by about 29% from 30.7% (40/130, control) to 39.6% (55/139, treatment)
* IFN treatment when the patients were on oxygen support: The death rate *increased* by 9% from 11.3% (163/1430, control) to 12.5% (178/1429, treatment) 
* IFN treatment when the patients didn't require oxygen: The death rate *decreased* by about 22% from 2.7% (13/490, control) to 2.1% (10/482, treatment).

> => 
> * As observed by other studies systemic IFN has an adverse effect at severe disease stages. 
> * If Subcutaneous IFN treatment started when no oxygen support was needed, the death rate decreased by roughly 20%.

Efficacy of interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir compared with remdesivir alone in hospitalised adults with COVID-19: a double-bind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. 2021 Oct 18.

##### Methods
* *Type and Setting:* "This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done at 63 hospitals in Japan (one site), Mexico (two sites), Singapore (two sites), South Korea (two sites), and the USA (56 sites)."
* *Patients:* "Patients also had to meet one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection at the time of enrolment: the presence of radiographic infiltrates on imaging; a peripheral oxygen saturation on room air of 94% or less; or requiring supplemental oxygen. Patients already on mechanical ventilation were excluded due to concerns of exacerbating the pulmonary inflammation." //  452 (IFN)/448 (control) with an ordinal score of 4 or 5 and 35 (IFN)/34 (control) with an ordinal score of 6

##### Treatment
"Hospitalised patients received up to four doses of either 44 μg interferon beta-1a or matched normal saline placebo administered subcutaneously every other day. The dose chosen was based on the bioavailability of interferon beta- 1a, which is approximately 30% after subcutaneous administration, with peak serum concentrations being reached with in several hours of receiving a dose.Serum concentrations of interferon beta-1a typically peak 3–15 h after intramuscular administration. Interferon beta-1a is excreted by hepatic and renal pathways. All hospitalised patients also received intravenous remdesivir as a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose administered daily for up to 9 days. All patients received standard supportive care by the trial site hospital, including glucocorticoids, but other experimental treatments for COVID-19 were prohibited."


##### Results
* Patients with an ordinal score of 6 at baseline: 7 (20%) of 35 patients in the IFN group died  and 4 (12%) of 34 patients in the control.
* Patients with an ordinal score of 4 or 5 at baseline: 14 (2.9%) of 487 in the IFN group died and 12 (2.5%) of 482 in the control group.
* Subgroup analyses (Figure 3 in the paper) indicate: A slight overall benefit for patients older than 65. An adverse effect for patients with an initial ordinal score of 6.

> => Subcutaneous IFN beta-1a has an adverse effect on patients with an ordinal score of 6 at treatment start. The treatment showed no benefit for patients at stages 4 or 5.

##### Setting
"Between 29 February and 3 April 2020, 92 patients were recruited, and a total of 42 patients in the IFN group and 39 patients in the control group completed the study."

##### Treatment 
"Each 44-microgram/ml (12 million IU/ml) dose of interferon beta-1a (ReciGen, CinnaGen Co., Iran) was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks." // medications in Table 3; of note Corticosteroid were given to 62% of IFN treated while only to 44% in the control

##### Results
* "The 28-day overall mortality was significantly lower in the IFN than the control group (19% versus 43.6%, respectively, P 􏰛 0.015)."
* "Regarding the time of IFN initiation, the analysis showed that early administration significantly reduced mortality (OR, 13.5; 95% CI, 1.5 to 118). However, late administration of IFN did not show significant effects (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.48 to 9.6)."

> => accounting the 4 dead dropouts from FIG 1 which likely belong to the late IFN group, late IFN seems to have an adverse effect. In the early IFN group on the other hand, the death rates seems to be around 10% (inferred from OR 13.5 and control group death rate) which indicates a mortality reduction of 75%.

##### Treatment
Single, 180 mcg subcutaneous dose of Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda) within 72 hours of diagnosis

##### Outcomes
1. Duration of viral shedding (primary endpoint) and 2. duration of symptoms (secondary endpoint).

##### Results
"In both the 60 patients receiving Lambda and 60 receiving placebo, the median time to cessation of viral shedding was 7 days (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 1.19). Symptoms resolved in 8 and 9 days in Lambda and placebo, respectively, and symptom duration did not differ significantly between groups (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.39)."

##### Methods 
"In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned to a single subcutaneous injection of peginterferon lambda 180 μg or placebo within 7 days of symptom onset or first positive swab if asymptomatic."

##### Results
"The decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was greater in those treated with peginterferon lambda than placebo from day 3 onwards, with a difference of 2·42 log copies per mL at day 7 (p=0·0041). By day 7, 24 (80%) participants in the peginterferon lambda group had an undetectable viral load, compared with 19 (63%) in the placebo group (p=0·15). After controlling for baseline viral load, patients in the peginterferon lambda group were more likely to have undetectable virus by day 7 than were those in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 4·12 [95% CI 1·15–16·73; p=0·029)."

> => Viral load declined faster in interferon lambda group.

##### Adverse Events
"Peginterferon lambda was well tolerated, and adverse events were similar between groups with mild and transient aminotransferase, concentration increases more frequently observed in the peginterferon lambda group."

Liu H, Ruan Z, Yin Z, Wu D, Zhu H. Association of administration of IFN-α with mortality among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019. Future Virology. 2021 Mar;16(3):201-9.

##### Methods
"In this retrospec- tive study, 103 of 1555 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were treated with IFN-α, and the others matched through propensity score matching."

##### Treatment
* IFN-α1b for injection (Shenzhen Kexing Biotech Co., Ltd Shenzhen, China). Administered as an intramuscular injection once a day. (15 patients)
* IFN-α2b spray (Tianjin Sinbobioway Biology). IFN-α2b 5 mIU was sprayed into the nose two-times a day for a total of 10 mIU per day. (89 patients)

> In the tables 1 and 2, IFN-α1b is named as spray, which is inconsistent with the above treatment description. 1 patient seems to have received both treatments for the numbers to add to 103.

##### Results
* IFN-α2b was associated with about 50% reduction in critical cases.
* 3 deaths in the IFN group compared to 18 in matched cases => indicates a mortality reduction of 83%.
