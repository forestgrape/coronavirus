## Public Description
Covid-19 can have many forms and accompanying [symptoms](#symptoms). Especially the early symptoms can differ a lot since they depend on in the respiratory tract where the infection starts. Generally all kind of respiratory symptoms (except a hoarse voice) can indicate Covid-19. 

Where and how Covid-19 starts determines the early phase of the disease and the corresponding symptoms. However if the body fails to clear the coronaviruses, they can well spread to other locations. So it possibly Covid-19 starting with a sore throat and one ends up in intense care with pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs. 

A SARS-CoV-2 infection can start
* in the upper respiratory tract. Symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases: a sore throat, coughing and a runny nose. Loss of smell or taste occurs too and is more specific to Covid-19. 
* in the throat. Coughing is typical, the body wants to get rid of the viruses in the respiratory tract. 
* in the deep lungs. That feels like it is starting from within. Early symptoms can be chills (because the body is increasing the temperature to fight the viruses) or just strange feeling, similar to a weak poisoning when having eaten something rotten or drunken too much. Feeling tired, energy-less and having an increased recovery time after sports are indications too. 

Most symptoms are not specific to Covid-19, they can have other causes: having another respiratory infection, having eaten something rotten, not having had enough sleep or an infection with other viruses. If the lungs get involved, symptoms can be a strange feeling in the chest like something sticky being inside (dry mucus loaded with viruses) or even shortness of breath (the lungs are inflamed). Diarrhea can both start early and later on and can outlast the respiratory infection by days or even weeks. 


## Symptoms
The symptoms can vary a lot especially in the beginning and for mild cases. In severe cases the lower respiratory tract is involved and thus fever, chest tightness and dry cough are common. See section [disease-pattering](#disease-pattering) 

### Early Symptoms
[in rework]
The early symptoms depend on the initial infection location. Since most infections occur airborne and start in the respiratory tract there are two main classes:
- **Lower Respiratory Tract**
  * A slight increase in temperature, can be below 38 degrees, has been observed in many patients ([Zhang](#zhang), [Wong](#wong), [Zhong](#zhong)). An increase as low as one degree can indication an infection.
  * dry cough (from deep)
  * feel of being unwell, muscle pain
- **Upper Respiratory Tract** 
  * loss of smell or taste
  * symptoms of a common cold: Runny nose, headache, sore throat, upper cough


## Fatality Rate
[in work]
The death rate depends on many factors and varies considerably. 
### Measure Method
The death rate depends on how a Covid-19 infection is defined and measured: E.g. not to all infection in the upper respiratory tract the body responds with antibodies or only antibodies of a specific type. On the other hand a lower respiratory tract infection may yield antibodies but be negative at a single PCR for the upper respiratory tract. 
### Estimates
[in work]
* John Ioannidis inferred the death rate from seroprevalence data across the world. Results:
  * 0.27% is the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate   (0.23% if corrected for the number of antibody types tested (immunoglobin, IgG, IgM, IgA))
  * 0.09% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rates less than the global average (< 118 deaths/million)
  * 0.20% in locations with 118â€“500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.57% in locations with > 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.05% corrected median for people younger than 70 years


## Infection Tropism 
How a virus infection behaves is an interplay of host factors including the host immune system, the behavior of the virus and environmental factors.

* __Host factors__ relevant for the tropism of Covid-19 are
    - Cells susceptible to infection and capable of producing viruses (e.g. red blood cells are not). 
    - Host immune system responses. The immune reactions depend both on the personal history and possible exposure of ancestors (genetic adaption).
* __Tropism of Sars-Cov-2__ 
    * Virions enter just cells containing a matching receptor and having been activated by proteases, more in the section [Coronavirus Life Cycle](./coronavirus.md#coronavirus-life-cycle)
* __Environmental Factors__ 
    - the travel of virions between hosts and thus the mode of the initial infection. E.g. in dry air exhaled droplets dry out and these are more likely to be absorbed deep in the lungs. 
    - Environmental factors influence host factors and thus indirectly the course of the disease.

## Appendix
> I likely had Covid-19 myself in early to mid March 2020 when temperatures were still about -10 degree Celsius in my area. For me the initial experience was very different from a common respiratory disease and so diagnosis was not obvious, at least back then: 1) lack of respiratory symptoms - not a single cough if I recall correctly -  2) the supposed low prior probability according to official prevalence and 3) lastly because I didn't want to have it and so was satisfied with not experiencing known and obvious symptoms. It first felt like a minor food poisoning but no vomiting or the like. Just felt strange for about two days. Soon these initial symptoms faded and I felt fit again. I went on doing some sport session which by itself went well, but it turned out to have been a bad idea: since in the following days some chills started and accompanied by a temperature increase, up to 36.x from my normal range 34.5 - 35 degrees. But since I didn't record the temperature systematically before, the temperature measurements of 36.x degrees were calming instead of ringing the bells. Later on temperature further increased to 37.x accompanied by a strange sticky feeling in the chest; at this point I started seriously considering Covid.

> Counting everything up it likely was Covid-19 and the sports session likely gave the viruses the opportunity to spread within the lungs. Noteworthy too: before the first symptoms, I had a long day and a rather stressful sleep afterwards, so the immune system likely not had enough time and resources to control the viruses. 
> All in all I should have been more careful and my behavior wasn't exemplary.
