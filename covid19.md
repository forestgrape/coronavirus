## Public Description
Covid-19 can have many forms and accompanying [symptoms](#symptoms). The symptoms vary since they depend on the [locations](#infection-locations) infected and SARS-CoV-2 can infect many locations throughout the respiratory tract except the vocal folds. So any kind of respiratory symptoms - except a hoarse voice - can indicate Covid-19. In risk regions with such symptoms one should avoid crowded indoor spaces and do a Covid test. 
Many of the symptoms are not specific to Covid-19, they can have other causes than SARS-CoV-2: having a (respiratory) infection with another virus or even bacteria, having eaten/drunken something harmful (e.g. rotten or too much alcohol and the like), not having had enough sleep.



## Virus Disease

> ##### Covid-19
> *Covid-19* stands for COronaVIrus Disease 2019.

> ##### Disease
> A *disease* is a biological disorder of structure or function in an organism causing inconvenience and/or unwanted effects. Literally disease means without-ease (dis=without, separated from). A disease is often dynamic and an immune response is induced/involved.

Chemical/biochemical damage such as dehydration or a poisoning or physical damage such as a fracture or an injury are not diseases themselves but they chemical/physical damage can result from a disease.

There are many different forms and causes of diseases:
* other [life forms](./coronavirus.md#life-form) such as 
  * bacteria
  * fungi
  * viruses
* autoimmune disease where the immune response is targets own substances

Necessary for a virus disease is a virus infection:

> ##### Virus Infection
> A *virus infects* an organism by infecting cells of the organism. A virus infects a cell by entering it and changing/hijacking the cells metabolism to produce virus progeny - called virions. More about virus infections is in [Introduction to Viruses](./coronavirus.md#introduction-to-viruses)

If a virus infection causes lack of ease, one has a virus disease. 

> ##### Virus Disease
> A *virus disease* is a [virus infection of an organism](./coronavirus.md#virus-infection) causing adverse effects. Such effects can be either directly through tissue damage caused by viruses but usually to keep the body virus free and prevent tissue damage a strong immune response is induced causing symptoms on its own e.g. fever. These definition is not strict, since adverse effects or tissue damage can be small and the virus infection is not considered as a diseases. 

So virus infections causing no inconvenience/lack of ease are often not considered as a diseases. The definition isn't uniform however, for viruses which can be highly pathogenic usually one speaks of a disease if there is an infection diagnosed regardless whether there are symptoms. Covid-19 is often used synonymously with having SARS-CoV-2 viruses detected in the upper respiratory tract [more in the section diagnosis](#diagnosis). 

## Disease Factors
A virus disease is an interplay of host factors including the host immune system, the behavior of the virus and environmental factors.

* __Host factors__ relevant for the tropism of Covid-19 are
    - Cells susceptible to infection and capable of producing viruses (not all cells are e.g. red blood cells are not).
    - Host [immune response](#immune-response-and-symptoms).
* __Tropism of SARS-2__
  Viruses behave different under different environmental factors, described in the section [Tropism of viruses](./coronavirus.md/tropism). E.g. SARS-2 virions enter just cells containing a matching receptor and having been activated by proteases. So to infect a tissue several conditions need to be met, more in the section [Tissue Tropism of SARS-CoV-2](./coronavirus.md/#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2).
* __Environmental Factors__
    - the travel of virions between hosts and thus the mode of the initial infection. E.g. in dry air exhaled droplets dry out and these are more likely to be deposited deep in the lungs.
    - Environmental factors can influence the host factors and the virus tropism and thus indirectly the course of the disease. E.g.:
      - Very dry air can weaken the immune system of the mucous membrane in the respiratory tract
      - Dirty air can weaken the clearance of particles in the respiratory tract since the ciliated cells can be damaged.



## Infection Locations
SARS-CoV-2 can infect different tissues in humans. Where and how much viruses infect different locations determines the locality of the tissue disordering and the immune response induced. 

Several section of this page shed light on different aspects of the infection locations:
* The section [Viral Load](#viral-load) describes in which body fluids and tissues how many virions are observed. 
* The [Immune Response and Symptoms](#immune-response-and-symptoms) section gives an overview of the different symptoms induced by the infection location.
* On the [coronavirus page](./coronavirus.md) in the section [tissue tropism](./coronavirus.md#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2) describes the tissue preferences of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 especially.
* The experimental page [Coronavirus Disease Pattering](./ideas_to_explore/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) describes that coronavirus infections at different locations can be experienced/observed as different diseases.




## Immune Response and Symptoms
[in work]

### Causes of Symptoms
The symptoms of a [virus disease](#virus-disease) are caused:
1. Direct symptoms through cell damage (rare)
2. Indirect symptoms through the induced [immune response](./immune_system.md) (frequent).

### Localized Symptoms
Coronavirus infections can be localized (especially in the early phase), therefore the symptoms can be local and depend on the locations infected. SARS-CoV-2 [infects different locations](#infection-locations). The disease patterns and symptoms caused at the different locations are described in more detail in the experimental section [disease-pattering](./ideas_to_explore/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md), here just a course and informal overview:

* Upper Respiratory Tract => Symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases: a sore throat, coughing and a runny nose. Loss of smell or taste occurs too and is more specific to Covid-19. 
* Throat => Coughing, the body wants to get rid of the viruses in the respiratory tract.
* Central Bronchi => Dry cough.
* Deep Lungs i.e. small bronchi, alveoli => If the lungs get involved, symptoms can be a strange feeling in the chest like something sticky being inside (dry mucus loaded with viruses) or even shortness of breath (the lungs are inflamed). Diarrhea can both start early and later on and can outlast the respiratory infection by days or even weeks.
* virions in the alveoli and spread to the blood => Early on virions are released into the blood. This feels like it is starting from within. Symptoms can be chills (because the body is increasing the temperature to fight the viruses) or just strange feeling, similar to a weak poisoning when having eaten something rotten or drunken too much. Feeling tired, energy-less and having an increased recovery time after sports are indications too.


## Diagnosis

### History of Covid-19 Diagnosis
* In late 2019 and early 2020 Covid-19 was often diagnosed based on lung CT findings.
* From February 2020 to December 2020 the most used method to diagnose Covid-19 is having a detectable viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. The viral load is detected either by PCR-Test or Antigen-Tests
* 2021? [Rethink Diagnosis](#rethink-diagnosis)


### Methods to Directly Detect Viruses
At locations infected by viruses or the lining fluids protecting/cleaning these locations the virions can be measured.
* #### Detect Building Blocks of Viruses
  To detect a virus infection the building blocks of virions can be searched.
  * ##### PCR Test 
    The genome of virions (positive single stranded RNA for coronaviruses). The amount of virions - called [viral load](#viral-load) - present can be determined and the specificity is very high.
  * ##### Antigen Test
    Methods detecting proteins of virions are usually called  (the name antigen since the virus proteins can be recognized by the immune system as harmful and antibodies can be produced against them)
* #### Detect Metabolism of Coronaviruses
  Temporary RNA produced from coronaviruses with a running metabolism.
* #### Detect Infectious Virions
  **Serology** Material possibly containing virions can be put on cell or organ cultures. These cell or organ cultures then can be inspected by another methods such as detecting tissue change or detecting RNA to see whether there were infectious virions in the material in question. The material can be diluted so much that virus colonies originating from single virions can be distinguished. Like this the number of infectious virions can be estimated.

### Methods to Indirectly Detect Viruses
* #### Detect Tissue damage
  * chemical e.g. detecting cell damage by detecting distinctive proteins.
  * optical e.g. round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid [to check and cite]
    (+) specific
    (-) radiation exposure for patient
    (-) only in diseases involving the lung significantly and thus sensitivity low
* #### Detect Immune Response
  For infections triggering certain alarms the immune response involves antibodies which can be detected in the blood. There are several kind of antibodies which are produced at different stages of an infections, these can be used to roughly back date the infection.

### Rethink Diagnosis
#### Locations
Coughed up sputum and salvia since easier to sample than the back of the nose and there are indications for a viral load similar or on average even slightly higher than in NPS samples as described in the section [Viral Load](#viral-load).


## Viral Load

> ##### Viral Load
> The *viral load* denotes how many virions are present in specimen of tissue or body fluid.

The viral load can be determined in the tissues, single cells or the body fluids which cover to protect and clean many of epithelial cell layers of the human body.


### Body Fluids
#### Salvia

#### Posterior Nose Mucus

#### Anterior Nose Mucus

#### Sputum

#### Broncho-alveolar-lavage (BAL)

#### Blood

### Tissues


## Fatality Rate
[in work]
The death rate depends on many factors and varies considerably. 
### Measure Method
The death rate depends on how a Covid-19 infection is defined and diagnosed: E.g. not to all infection in the upper respiratory tract the body responds with antibodies or only antibodies of a specific type. On the other hand a lower respiratory tract infection may yield antibodies but be negative at a single PCR for the upper respiratory tract. 
### Estimates
[in work]
* John Ioannidis infers the death rate from seroprevalence data across the world. Results:
  * 0.27% is the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate   (0.23% if corrected for the number of antibody types tested (immunoglobin, IgG, IgM, IgA))
  * 0.09% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rates less than the global average (< 118 deaths/million)
  * 0.20% in locations with 118–500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.57% in locations with > 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.05% corrected median for people younger than 70 years

### Viral Load in the Upper Respiratory Tract

#### Azzi
##### Methods
Saliva samples of 25 patients with severe COVID-19 are analyzed by rRT-PCR.
##### Results
* "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all 25 patients first salivary swab, with different Ct values (range 18.12–32.23, mean value 27.16 +/− 3.07), but all of them were under the Ct value of 33."
* "Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation between the LDH values recorded in the haematochemical analyses and the Ct values, thus the viral load detected in the saliva was correlated to the tissue damage reported by biomarkers (p = 0.04) (Table 2) (Fig. 1a and b)."
* "In contrast, there was not a significant correlation between usRCT and the Ct values (p = 0.07), but an inverse tendency between this inflammatory index and the viral load detected in saliva (Fig. 1c and d) was observed."
* "A striking feature was highlighted in two patients who showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar swabs proved to be negative."

**Saliva as a possible tool for the SARS-CoV-2 detection: A review**

Helpful summaries of 39 studies analyzing the viral load in salvia. 
##### Methods
Search for (“saliva”) and (“SARS-CoV-2” or “coronavirus” or “COVID-1”) in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus yielded:
"A total of 363 studies were identified by  and 39 were selected for review."
##### Key findings
* In most studies saliva samples yielded a viral load similar as NPS samples. 
* For most studies: When NPS samples were positive salvia samples were positive in over 70% of the cases. 
* For most studies: When salvia samples were positive NPS samples were positive Salivary samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection was as consistent and sensitive as the nasopharyngeal swabs in most studies, having been effective in detecting asymptomatic infections previously tested negative in nasopharyngeal samples."

#### Iwasaki
##### Methods
Analyzed the viral nasopharyngeal and saliva samples in 76 patients.
##### Results
* 8 patients were positive for both salvia and nasopharyngeal probes. 1 patient for salvia only and 1 for nasopharyngeal only. 
* A weak tendency for salvia samples to have a higher viral load early and nasopharyngeal swabs in the later phase of Covid-19 was observed. 

#### Güclü
**Comparison of saliva and oro-nasopharyngeal swab sample in the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19**
##### Methods 
Three groups of patients are analyzed:
* "Group 1 (30 patients): Hospitalized patients with a finding consistent with COVID-19 in the CT scan of the lung and detected SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in at least one ONS sample."
* "Group 2 (15 patients): Hospitalized patients with a finding compatible with COVID-19 in lung CT examination, but in whom SARS-CoV-2 were not detected in at least two ONS samples by PCR."
* "Group 3 (19 patients): Patients who present to the emergency department with complaints compatible with COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath) but have normal CT."
##### Results
* Group 1: Saliva samples were positive in 21 (70%) of the 30 patients in Group 1. All ONS samples by group construction. 
* Group 2: Two salvia samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. No positive ONS samples by group construction.
* Group 3: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the saliva of two patients, and only in ONS of one patient.

J Clin Microbiol 58:e01946-20. https:// doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01946-20.
##### Methods
"An enhanced saliva specimen (i.e., strong sniff, elicited cough, and collection of saliva/secretions) was collected without transport medium prior to collection of NPS from 224 patients with symptoms deemed consistent with COVID-19."
##### Results
216 of the 224 patients had analyzed both samples without errors (9 errors in total).

Salvia\Swab | Swab positive | Swab negative | Total
--|--|--|--
Saliva positive | 38        | 1             | 39 
Salvia negative |  0        | 177           | 177
Total           | 38        | 178           | 216 

###### Notes
* "The overall mean (SD) CT value for the positive NPS specimens was 20.55 (5.36) cycles, whereas the corresponding overall mean (SD) CT value for enhanced saliva specimens was 24.16 (4.80) cycles, for a mean difference in CT value for paired NPS and saliva specimens of -3.61 (95% CI, -5.78 to -1.44; P = 0.002)."
* "There was little correlation between the CT values (i.e., viral loads) of the positive saliva and NPS specimens (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.162; P = 0.333) (Fig. 1C)."


#### Williams
**Saliva as a non-invasive specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2**
##### Methods
* Between 25th March and 1st April 2020 in Melbourne, 622 patients provided NPS samples, 522 of those 622 patients provided saliva and NPS samples for Covid-19 tests. 
* Patients were asked to pool saliva in their mouth for 1-2 minutes prior to collection.
##### Results
* 39 of 622 (6.3%) patients had PCR-positive NPS, and 33 of those 39 (84.6% of NPS positive) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in saliva.
* 1 positive of 50 (2%) salvia samples of patients whose NPS sample was negative.
##### Limitations
Data not uniform/consistent:
* Of the 622 patients with NPS samples only 522 provided salvia samples (but not written if the positive 39 belonged to the 522).
* Only 50 salvia samples of all those negative with negative NPS were analyzed.

## Appendix
> #### Personal Covid Experience
> I likely had Covid-19 myself in early to mid March 2020 when temperatures were still about -10 degree Celsius in my area. For me the initial experience was very different from a common respiratory disease and so diagnosis was not obvious, at least back then: 1) lack of respiratory symptoms - not a single cough if I recall correctly -  2) the supposed low prior probability according to official prevalence and 3) lastly because I didn't want to have it and so was satisfied with not experiencing known and obvious symptoms. It first felt like a minor food poisoning but no vomiting or the like. Just felt strange for about two days. Soon these initial symptoms faded and I felt fit again. I went on doing some sport session which by itself went well, but it turned out to have been a bad idea: since in the following days some chills started and accompanied by a temperature increase, up to 36.x from my normal 35 degrees. But since I didn't record the temperature systematically before, the temperature measurements of 36.x degrees were more calming instead of ringing the bells. Later on temperature further increased to 37.x accompanied by a strange sticky feeling in the chest; at this point I started to consider Covid as likely.
> Counting everything up it likely was Covid-19 and the sports session likely gave the viruses the opportunity to spread within the lungs. Noteworthy too: before the first symptoms, I had a long day and a rather stressful sleep afterwards, so the immune system likely not had enough time and resources to control the viruses. 
> All in all I should have been more careful and wasn't exemplary in the early and mid phase.
