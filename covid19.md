## Public Description
Covid-19 has different clinical pictures and [symptoms](#immune-response-and-symptoms). The appearances vary since they depend on the [locations](#infection-locations) infected andq SARS-CoV-2 can infect many locations in the respiratory tract except the vocal folds. Therefore any kind of respiratory symptoms - except a hoarse voice - can indicate Covid-19. With such symptoms one should avoid crowded indoor spaces and do a Covid test. 
Many of the symptoms are not specific to Covid-19, they may have other causes than SARS-CoV-2: having a (respiratory) infection with different virus or a bacterium, having eaten/drunken something harmful (e.g. rotten or too much alcohol and the like)or just not having had enough sleep.



## Introduction

> ##### Disease
> A *disease* is a biological disorder of structure or function in an organism causing inconvenience and/or unwanted effects. Literally disease means without-ease (dis=without, separated from). A disease is often dynamic and an immune response is induced/involved.

Chemical/biochemical damages such as dehydration, a poisoning or physical damage such as a fracture or an injury are not diseases themselves but chemical/physical damage can result from a disease.

There are many different causes of diseases:
* other [life forms](./coronavirus.md#life-form) interfering with the metabolism, such an interference is called [infection as defined below](#virus-infection). 
  * outside of cells but inside multicellular organisms
    * most bacteria
    * fungi
  * inside cells
    * some bacteria
    * all viruses
* immune disease in which the immune system overreacts to substances without need (notes on the immune system in the [Immune System chapter](./immune_system.md))

Virus diseases are cause by virus infections:

> ##### Virus Infection
> A *virus infects* an organism by infecting cells of the organism. A virus infects a cell by entering it and changing/hijacking the cells metabolism to produce virus progeny - called virions. More about viruses and their infections in the chapter [Introduction to Viruses](./coronavirus.md#introduction-to-viruses)

If a virus infection causes lack of ease, one has a virus disease:

> ##### Virus Disease
> A *virus disease* is a [virus infection of an organism](./coronavirus.md#virus-infection) causing adverse effects. 

Adverse effects result either directly through tissue damage caused by viruses or more frequent to keep the body virus free (to prevent future cell/tissue damage) a strong immune response is induced causing effects on its own.

The definition of a virus disease is not strict:  
* Adverse effects or tissue damage are often small and no lack of ease is caused. For most viruses very mild infections are not considered diseases. 
* For viruses which can be highly pathogenic usually one speaks of a disease if there is an infection diagnosed regardless whether there are symptoms or adverse effects.

> ##### Covid-19
> *Covid-19* stands for COronaVIrus Disease 2019. As of December 2020, all SARS-CoV-2 infections are called Covid-19. 

In colloquial language, "Covid-19" is often used synonymously with having SARS-CoV-2 viruses detected in the upper respiratory tract, often tested by nasopharyngeal sampling and PCR testing. However the situation is not that simple:  
* Not all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a detectable amount of viruses in the nose since SARS-CoV-2 can infect the lower respiratory tract only. Especially people with a sensible immune system may experience symptoms without having a detectable viral load in the upper respiratory tract. But it is also possible to have severe Covid-19 without having detectable viruses by nose swabs [citation in work].  
* On the contrary some people have a detectable viral load in the upper respiratory tract but no symptoms. The following terms describe the symptom stage of a person.

More about in the sections [Diagnosis](#diagnosis) and Locations](#infection-locations).

> ##### Symptomatic
> A person experiencing/notifying/showing symptoms of a disease is called symptomatic. 
> ##### Asymptomatic
> A person *not* experiencing/notifying/showing symptoms while having an infection is called asymptomatic.
> ##### Presymptomatic
> Even those person developing symptoms are asymptomatic in the early phase of a disease during these phase a person is called presymptomatic. 

## Disease Factors
A virus disease is an interplay of host factors including the host immune system, of the behavior of the virus and of environmental factors.

* __Host factors__ relevant for the tropism of Covid-19 are
    - Cells susceptible to infection and capable of producing viruses (not all cells are susceptible e.g. red blood cells are not).
    - Host [immune response](#immune-response-and-symptoms).
* __Tropism of SARS-2__
  Viruses behave different under different environmental factors, described in the section [Tropism of viruses](./coronavirus.md/tropism). E.g. SARS-2 virions can enter only cells containing a matching receptor. To infect a tissue several conditions must be met as described in the chapter [Tissue Tropism of SARS-CoV-2](./coronavirus.md/#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2).
* __Environmental Factors__
    - the travel of virions between hosts and thus the mode of the initial infection. E.g. in dry air exhaled droplets dry out and these are more likely to be deposited deep in the lungs.
    - Environmental factors can influence the host factors as well as the virus tropism and thus indirectly the course of the disease. E.g.:
      - Very dry air can weaken the immune system of the mucous membrane in the respiratory tract
      - Dirty air can weaken the clearance of particles in the respiratory tract e.g. by damaging ciliated cells.



## Infection Locations
SARS-CoV-2 infects different tissues in humans. The effects from the virus infection such as tissue damage and symptoms are often local to the infected locations. 

Different topics related to the infection locations are described in the sections:
* The section [Viral Load](#viral-load) describes in which body fluids and tissues how many virions are observed. 
* The [Immune Response and Symptoms](#immune-response-and-symptoms) section gives an overview of the different symptoms induced by the infection location.
* On the [coronavirus page](./coronavirus.md), the section [tissue tropism](./coronavirus.md#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2) describes the tissue preferences of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 especially.
* The experimental page [Coronavirus Disease Pattering](./ideas_to_explore/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) describes that coronavirus infections at different locations can be experienced/observed as different diseases.

### Common Infection Location
* Upper Respiratory Tract => Symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases: a sore throat, coughing and a runny nose. Loss of smell or taste.
* Throat => Coughing, the body wants to get rid of the viruses in the respiratory tract.
* Central Bronchi => Dry cough.
* Deep Lungs i.e. small bronchi, alveoli => If the lungs get involved, symptoms can be a strange feeling in the chest like something sticky being inside (dry mucus loaded with viruses) or even shortness of breath (the lungs are inflamed). Diarrhea can both start early and later on and can outlast the respiratory infection by days or even weeks.
* virions in the alveoli and spread to the blood => Early on virions are released into the blood. This feels like it is starting from within. Symptoms can be chills (because the body is increasing the temperature to fight the viruses) or just strange feeling, similar to a weak poisoning when having eaten something rotten or drunken too much. Feeling tired, energy-less and having an increased recovery time after sports are indications too.



## Immune Response and Symptoms
[in work]

### Causes of Symptoms
The symptoms of a [virus disease](#virus-disease) are caused:
1. Direct symptoms through cell damage (rare)
2. Indirect symptoms through the induced [immune response](./immune_system.md) (frequent).

### Localized Symptoms
Coronavirus infections can be localized (especially in the early phase), therefore the symptoms can be local and depend on the locations infected as described in the section [Infection Locations and Symptoms](#infection-location-and-symptoms). 




## Diagnosis

### History of Covid-19 Diagnosis
* In late 2019 and early 2020 Covid-19 was often diagnosed based on lung CT findings.
* From February 2020 to December 2020 the most used method to diagnose Covid-19, is having a detectable amount of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. The viral load is detected either by [PCR-Test](#pcr-test) or [Antigen-Tests](#antigen-test). In the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemics when the bottleneck was the availability of accurate PCR tests. 
* Late 2020 antigen tests are getting more common.
* 2021? Alternate Locations? [Review of Diagnosis](#review-of-diagnosis)

### Methods to Directly Detect Viruses
In tissues containing infected cells or in the lining fluids protecting/cleaning these tissues the viral load can be measured.
* #### Detect Building Blocks of Viruses
  To detect viruses replicating the building blocks of virions can be searched.
  * ##### PCR Test 
    The genome of virions (positive single stranded RNA for coronaviruses). The amount of virions - called [viral load](#viral-load) - present can be determined with high specificity.
  * ##### Antigen Test
    Methods detecting proteins of virions are usually called antigen tests (virus proteins are called antigens since these proteins can be recognized by the immune system as harmful).
  * ##### PCR vs Antigen Tests
    The sensitivity and specificity of antigen tests depend on the exact antigen test and tend to be lower for most antigen tests available as of December 2020.
* #### Detect Metabolism of Coronaviruses
  Temporary RNA produced from coronaviruses with a running metabolism.
* #### Detect Infectious Virions
  Samples possibly containing virions can be put on cell or organ cultures. These cell or organ cultures then can be inspected by another methods such as detecting tissue change/damage or detecting RNA to see whether there were infectious virions in the  samples. The samples can be diluted so much that virus colonies originating from single virions can be distinguished. In this  way the number of infectious virions can be determined.

### Methods to Indirectly Detect Viruses
* #### Detect Tissue damage
  * chemical e.g. detecting cell damage by detecting distinctive proteins.
    (-) not specific
  * optical e.g. round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid-19 [to check and cite]
* #### Detect Immune Response
  * #### Antibody Test
    [in work] <!--td: update immune sys page with antibodies>
    For infections triggering certain alarms the immune response involves antibodies which can be detected in the blood. The antibodies are in the serum of the blood. Methods analyzing the blood serum are called *serology* and often antibody test are referred serological test. There are different kind of antibodies which are produced at different stages during and after an infection. Infections in later stages and past infections can be laboratory diagnosed. 


### Diagnosis Locations
Locations with active viral replication ([Infected Locations](#infection-locations)) or a viral load ([Viral Load](#viral-load)) through deposition are suitable for diagnosis.

The fluids in the respiratory tract are a good locations to detect SARS-CoV-2 virions:
* Since SARS-CoV-2 infects and transmits mainly through the respiratory tract, the respiratory tracts is the place to search
* The virions mostly are released on the apical side and therefore there are virions in the fluids covering infected tissues. 
* For accessibility reasons fluids in the upper respiratory are preferred. However the largest number of susceptible cells to SARS-CoV-2 are in the lower respiratory tract.


### Review of Common Diagnostic Methods
* #### Nasopharyngeal Swabs with PCR
  The current 'gold standard' for Covid-19 diagnosis are nasopharyngeal swabs. 
  (+/-) quite easy to take but trained persons are needed
  (+) the sensitivity is good for severe infections. 
* #### Nasopharyngeal Swabs with Antigen Tests
  as for Nasopharyngeal but 
* #### Salvia with PCR
  Salvia since easier to sample than the back of the nose. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in salvia mixed with cough up sputum seems to perform as well or even better as NPS (section [Viral Load](#viral-load) and [summary Lee](#summarized-review-lee).
* #### Salvia with Antigen Tests
* #### Lung CT
  round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid [to check and cite]
    (+) specific
    (+) detects infection of the lung regardless whether there are viruses in the upper respiratory tract
    (-) radiation exposure for patient
    (-) only in diseases involving the lung significantly and thus sensitivity low
    => recommended for symptomatic risk patients of very high age with negative test in the upper respiratory tract

### Challenges regarding Viral Load and Diagnosis
Often investigations for viral load are biased. Reasons are:
* Sampling is biased towards symptomatic patients. Not necessarily bad since symptomatic patients are more infectious ([Section Infectors and Symptoms](./spread_analyses.md#infectors-and-symptoms) in the Chapter Spread Analyses) and more at risk for severe disease.
* Often NPS samples are taking as a 'Gold Standard' to diagnose Covid-19. Measuring viral load e.g. in salvia is often compared to NPS viral load and sometimes NPS sampling is assigned a sensitivity of 100%.
* E.g. not to every infection in the upper respiratory tract the body responds with antibodies or only antibodies of a specific type. On the other hand a lower respiratory tract infection may yield antibodies, but be negative at a single PCR in the upper respiratory tract.


## Viral Load
[**in work and unfinished**]

> ##### Viral Load
> The *viral load* denotes how many virions are present in specimen of tissue or body fluid.

A viral load is observed in locations with active viral replication. Sometimes a viral load can be detected upon deposition of virions from other infected locations. While the latter is necessary for the initial infection event of a location, the viral load through deposition is often to low to be detected. However often happens local amplification. 
### Local Amplification: 
While the lung is primarily infected and both responsible for the spread to other persons and the symptoms, there are susceptible cells in the nose or in the salviary glands for SARS-CoV-2 replication and thus the deposited virions replicated and so the viral load is amplified there. Therefore the nose mucus or salvia are have a detectable viral load and thus are suitable for diagnosis. 

Knowing the viral load observed in different fluids and tissues is relevant for:
* __Diagnosis__: The viral load is optimally high for the different disease patterns caused by SARS-CoV-2 and taking specimens easy.  
* __Transmission__: Knowing the viral load in different locations can help to understand and prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
* __Understanding Covid-19__: Knowing at which stages which locations are infected by the coronaviruses can help to predict the disease progression and to optimize the treatment. 




### Types of Specimens
#### Body Fluids
Coronaviruses virions are mostly released on the apical surfaces and so the virions in the fluids covering infected cells.
#### Tissues
Since sampling fluids is enough in most cases tissues are rarely sampled. 

### Locations
#### Upper Respiratory Tract
[in work] A recommended review is by [Lee et al](#summary-review-lee).
##### Salvia
Reviewed in [Lee et al](#summarized-review-lee) and [da Silva](#summarized-review-dasilva). A recommended read is [Yokota](#summary-yokota)
##### Posterior Nose Mucus
Is obtained by nasopharyngeal swabs and the most used location for detecting Covid-19 (as of December 2020). 
##### Anterior Nose Mucus
Reviewed in [Lee et al](#summarized-review-lee)
##### Sputum
* Salvia with coughed up sputum 
#### Lower Respiratory Tract
Despite the lower respiratory tract is the most relevant location, the viral load in these locations is less known especially for mild cases since sampling is complicated. 
##### Broncho-alveolar-lavage fluid (BAL)

#### Blood

### Tissues


## Fatality Rate
[in work]
The death rate depends on many factors and varies considerably.

### Measure Method
The death rate depends on how a Covid-19 infection is [defined](#covid-19) and [diagnosed](#diagnosis).

### Estimates
[in work]
* John Ioannidis infers the death rate from seroprevalence data across the world. Results:
  * 0.27% is the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate   (0.23% if corrected for the number of antibody types tested (immunoglobin, IgG, IgM, IgA))
  * 0.09% infection-fatality-rate in locations with COVID-19 population-mortality-rates less than the global average (< 118 deaths/million)
  * 0.20% infection-fatality-rate in locations with 118–500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.57% infection-fatality-rate in locations with > 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.05% infection-fatality-rate corrected median for people younger than 70 years

### Viral Load in the Upper Respiratory Tract

#### Summarized Review Lee
Lee, Rose & Herigon, Joshua & Benedetti, Andrea & Pollock, Nira & Denkinger, Claudia. (2020). **Performance of Saliva, Oropharyngeal Swabs, and Nasal Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.** 10.1101/2020.11.12.20230748. 
A review and meta analysis. Helpful plots showing uniformly the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in NPS/salvia/NS for the reviewed studies and aggregated detection rates for different features (e.g. symptomatic) and different collection methods (NPS/Salvia/NS). 
##### Methods
"We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval October 1st, 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types [saliva, oropharyngeal (OP), and nasal (NS) swabs] versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT)." => "From 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting 15 inclusion criteria."
##### Findings
The results from the different studies/data aggregated by feature are summarized to a figure which shows % positive alternate specimens, % positive NP specimens and (if available) % specimens where both NP and alternate are positive. 
Selected aggregated results, the complete list is found in Figure 2 in the paper. 
* Overall salvia they conclude a detection rate of 88% for salvia and 94% for NPS //both detection rates are likely much lower see Limitations 
* Cough or deep  throat salvia have a detection rate of 94% while NPS have 89%.
* Asymptomatic patients have a detection rate of 87% in salvia and 73% in NPS
* Symptomatic Patients have a detection rate of 88% in salvia and 96% in NPS
##### Limitations
To my checking for some studies NPS are taken as a reference method and assigned a sensitivity of 100% [to confirm and check]. Therefore the detection rates should be interpreted as relative numbers comparing NPS and alternate specimens and not as absolute detection rates.

Helpful summaries of 39 studies, which analyze the viral load in salvia. 
##### Methods
Search for (“saliva”) and (“SARS-CoV-2” or “coronavirus” or “COVID-1”) in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus yielded:
"A total of 363 studies were identified by  and 39 were selected for review."
##### Findings
* For most studies: Saliva samples yielded a viral load similar to NPS samples. 
* For most studies: If NPS samples were positive, salvia samples were positive in 70% or more cases. 
* For most studies: If salvia samples were positive NPS samples were positive. 
* "Salivary samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection was as consistent and sensitive as the nasopharyngeal swabs in most studies, having been effective in detecting asymptomatic infections previously tested negative in nasopharyngeal samples."

##### Methods
Saliva samples of 25 patients with severe COVID-19 are analyzed by rRT-PCR.
##### Results
* "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all 25 patients first salivary swab, with different Ct values (range 18.12–32.23, mean value 27.16 +/− 3.07), but all of them were under the Ct value of 33."
* "Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation between the LDH values recorded in the haematochemical analyses and the Ct values, thus the viral load detected in the saliva was correlated to the tissue damage reported by biomarkers (p = 0.04) (Table 2) (Fig. 1a and b)."
* "In contrast, there was not a significant correlation between usRCT and the Ct values (p = 0.07), but an inverse tendency between this inflammatory index and the viral load detected in saliva (Fig. 1c and d) was observed."
* "A striking feature was highlighted in two patients who showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar swabs proved to be negative."

##### Methods 
Three groups of patients are analyzed:
* "Group 1 (30 patients): Hospitalized patients with a finding consistent with COVID-19 in the CT scan of the lung and detected SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in at least one ONS sample."
* "Group 2 (15 patients): Hospitalized patients with a finding compatible with COVID-19 in lung CT examination, but in whom SARS-CoV-2 were not detected in at least two ONS samples by PCR."
* "Group 3 (19 patients): Patients who present to the emergency department with complaints compatible with COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath) but have normal CT."
##### Results
* Group 1: Saliva samples were positive in 21 (70%) of the 30 patients in Group 1. All ONS samples by group construction. 
* Group 2: Two salvia samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. No positive ONS samples by group construction.
* Group 3: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the saliva of two patients, and only in ONS of one patient. 

#### Summary Huber


##### Methods
* "Adults and children that qualified for a regular SARS-CoV-2 test according to the FOPH (Swiss federal office of public health) and reported to one of the participating test centers or emergency units were enrolled from October 20, 2020 to November 4, 2020. In total 1187 individuals (male 54.8%/female 45.2%) were included (Table1)." 
* "Participants were either asked to clear the throat thoroughly (“Basic”, N = 835) or in an intensified protocol to clear it three times (“Enhanced”, N = 352) and collect about 0.5 – 1 ml of saliva."
* "In the present study, neither eating, drinking nor smoking was controlled as study subjects came for an elective analysis by NPS and thus could only be informed about the saliva sampling on site immediately before the collection."
*  "Immediately after saliva collection, VTM (virus transport medium) was added to the crude saliva and the content mixed through gentle twisting." 
*  "Saliva was collected directly after NPS and both specimens immediately sent for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing."
##### Results

Total           |       248 |         939   | 1187 


* "We observed decreasing viral loads with ongoing symptomatic infection in both saliva and NPS, highlighting a transient window of detection in the upper respiratory tract. Interestingly, changes in saliva were overall less dynamic than in NPS (Figure 4B)."
* "In line with a trend to lower viral loads, i.e. higher Ct values in absence of symptoms (asymptomatic median Ct 28.4; mild symptoms median Ct 23.7; strong symptoms median Ct 21.6)"
* "Up to a Ct 33 (equivalent to approximately 26’000 genome copies/ml) in the corresponding NPS, a notably high PPA (97.6%) is reached."

#### Summary Williams
**Saliva as a non-invasive specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2**
##### Methods
* Between 25th March and 1st April 2020 in Melbourne, 622 patients provided NPS samples, 522 of those 622 patients provided saliva and NPS samples for Covid-19 tests. 
* Patients were asked to pool saliva in their mouth for 1-2 minutes prior to collection.
##### Results
* 39 of 622 (6.3%) patients had PCR-positive NPS, and 33 of those 39 (84.6% of NPS positive) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in saliva.
* 1 positive of 50 (2%) salvia samples of patients whose NPS sample was negative.

Advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1388
##### Methods
Individuals from two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort had specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples analyzed by PCR. 
##### Results
"In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence at 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva."
##### Conclusion
"Both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity. Self- collected saliva is a valuable specimen to detect SARS-CoV-2 in mass screening of asymptomatic persons."

#### Summary Zhou
**SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Upper Respiratory Specimens of Infected Patients**
#### Methods
"We analyzed the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients in relation to day of onset of any symptoms (Fig. 1C)." 
#### Results
* "Higher viral loads (inversely related to Ct value) were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat." 
* "Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza4 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV."
* "The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients."
* The nasal and throat swabs of many patients don't have single local maxima but several. Moreover they can reach 0 one day and be positive the next day. //=> to exclude infection several negative samples are needed.

## Appendix
> #### Personal Covid Experience
> I likely had Covid-19 myself in early to mid March 2020 when temperatures were still about -10 degree Celsius in my area. For me the initial experience was very different from a common respiratory disease and so diagnosis was not obvious, at least back then: 1) lack of respiratory symptoms - not a single cough if I recall correctly -  2) the supposed low prior probability according to official prevalence and 3) because I didn't want to have it and so was satisfied with not experiencing known and obvious symptoms. It first felt like a minor food poisoning but no vomiting or the like. Just felt strange for about two days. Soon these initial symptoms faded and I felt fit again. I went on doing some sport session which by itself went well, but it turned out to have been a bad idea: since in the following days some chills started and accompanied by a temperature increase, up to 36.x from my normal 35 degrees. But since I didn't record the temperature systematically before, the temperature measurements of 36.x degrees were more calming instead of ringing the bells. Later on temperature further increased to 37.x accompanied by a strange sticky feeling in the chest; at this point I started to consider Covid as likely.
> Counting everything up it likely was Covid-19 and the sports session likely gave the viruses the opportunity to spread within the lungs. Noteworthy too: before the first symptoms, I had a long day and a rather stressful sleep afterwards, so the immune system likely not had enough time and resources to control the viruses.
