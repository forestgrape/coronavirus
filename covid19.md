## Public Description
Covid-19 can have many forms and accompanying [symptoms](#symptoms). The symptoms differ a lot since they depend on the tissues which are infected. Any kind of respiratory symptoms (except a hoarse voice) can indicate Covid-19. In risk regions with such symptoms one should avoid crowded indoor spaces and do a Covid test. 
However many of the symptoms are not specific to Covid-19, they can have other causes than SARS-CoV-2: having a (respiratory) infection with another virus or even bacteria, having eaten/drunken something harmful (e.g. rotten or too much alcohol and the like), not having had enough sleep.

## Introduction

> ##### Covid-19
> *Covid-19* stands for Coronavirus Disease 2019.

> ##### Disease
> A *disease* is a biological disorder of structure or function in an organism causing inconvenience and unwanted effects. Often an immune system response is induced. Literally without-ease (dis=without, separated from). 

There are many different forms of diseases. Here only virus diseases are discussed.

> ##### Virus disease
> A *virus disease* is a [virus infection of an organism] causing adverse effects. Such effects can be either directly through tissue damage caused by viruses or by (side effects) of the immune response.

How a virus disease behaves is an interplay of host factors including the host immune system, the behavior of the virus and environmental factors.

* __Host factors__ relevant for the tropism of Covid-19 are
    - Cells susceptible to infection and capable of producing viruses (not all cells are e.g. red blood cells are not).
    - Host immune system response. The immune system is described on the [immune system page](./immune_system.md). The immune response depends on the  and how much and were
* __Tropism of SARS-2__
  Viruses behave different under different environmental factors, described in the section [Tropism of viruses](./coronavirus.md/tropism). E.g. SARS-2 virions enter just cells containing a matching receptor and having been activated by proteases. So to infect a tissue several conditions need to be met, more in the section [Tissue Tropism of SARS-CoV-2](./coronavirus.md/#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2).
* __Environmental Factors__
    - the travel of virions between hosts and thus the mode of the initial infection. E.g. in dry air exhaled droplets dry out and these are more likely to be deposited deep in the lungs.
    - Environmental factors can influence the host factors and the virus tropism and thus indirectly the course of the disease. E.g.:
      - Very dry air can weaken the immune system of the mucous membrane in the respiratory tract
      - Dirty air can weaken the clearance of particles in the respiratory tract since the ciliated cells can be damaged.

 Where and how much viruses infect different locations determines the disordering of the tissues directly and indirectly through the immune response induced.


## Infection Locations
SARS-CoV-2 can infect different tissues in humans, described on the coronavirus page in the section [tissue tropism](./coronavirus.md#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2)
* the upper respiratory tract => Symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases: a sore throat, coughing and a runny nose. Loss of smell or taste occurs too and is more specific to Covid-19. 
* the throat => Coughing, the body wants to get rid of the viruses in the respiratory tract.
* main bronchi => Dry cough.
* the deep lungs i.e. small bronchi, alveoli => If the lungs get involved, symptoms can be a strange feeling in the chest like something sticky being inside (dry mucus loaded with viruses) or even shortness of breath (the lungs are inflamed). Diarrhea can both start early and later on and can outlast the respiratory infection by days or even weeks.
* virions in the alveoli and spread to the blood => Early on virions are released into the blood. All in all this feels like it is starting from within. Symptoms can be chills (because the body is increasing the temperature to fight the viruses) or just strange feeling, similar to a weak poisoning when having eaten something rotten or drunken too much. Feeling tired, energy-less and having an increased recovery time after sports are indications too.

## Symptoms
The symptoms can vary a lot especially in the beginning and for mild cases. In severe cases the lower respiratory tract is involved and thus fever, chest tightness and dry cough are common. See section [disease-pattering](#disease-pattering) 

### Early Symptoms
[in rework]
The early symptoms depend on the initial infection location. Since most infections occur airborne and start in the respiratory tract there are two main classes:
- **Lower Respiratory Tract**
  * A slight increase in temperature, can be below 38 degrees, has been observed in many patients ([Zhang](#zhang), [Wong](#wong), [Zhong](#zhong)). An increase as low as one degree can indication an infection.
  * dry cough (from deep)
  * feel of being unwell, muscle pain
- **Upper Respiratory Tract** 
  * loss of smell or taste
  * symptoms of a common cold: Runny nose, headache, sore throat, upper cough


## Diagnosis

### Diagnosis Relevance

### Diagnosis Methods
When a virus replicates inside a cell the virus produces new rough copies of itself called virions. These virions consist of a genome (encoded in a storage format: RNA or DNA) and proteins. To detect viruses replicating inside cells these building blocks are measured. 
* RNA
  * the storage RNA i.e. the RNA making up the genome of virions
   By this method the amount of virions - called [viral load](#viral-load) - present can be determined with high specificity. 
  * temporary RNA produced during active virus replication
   This method can be used to detect whether the viruses are currently replicating. 
* Proteins of virions
  Methods detecting proteins of virions are usually called **antigen tests** (since the virus proteins can be recognized by the immune system as harmful and antibodies can be produced against them)
* Tissue damage
  * chemical e.g. detecting cell damage by detecting distinctive proteins.
  * optical e.g. round glassy occupancies in the lung are typical for Covid
  (+) specific
  (-) radiation exposure for patient
  (-) only in diseases involving the lung severely thus sensitivity low
* 

## Viral Load



## Fatality Rate
[in work]
The death rate depends on many factors and varies considerably. 
### Measure Method
The death rate depends on how a Covid-19 infection is defined and diagnosed: E.g. not to all infection in the upper respiratory tract the body responds with antibodies or only antibodies of a specific type. On the other hand a lower respiratory tract infection may yield antibodies but be negative at a single PCR for the upper respiratory tract. 
### Estimates
[in work]
* John Ioannidis inferred the death rate from seroprevalence data across the world. Results:
  * 0.27% is the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate   (0.23% if corrected for the number of antibody types tested (immunoglobin, IgG, IgM, IgA))
  * 0.09% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rates less than the global average (< 118 deaths/million)
  * 0.20% in locations with 118â€“500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.57% in locations with > 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.05% corrected median for people younger than 70 years


## Appendix
> #### Personal Covid Experience
> I likely had Covid-19 myself in early to mid March 2020 when temperatures were still about -10 degree Celsius in my area. For me the initial experience was very different from a common respiratory disease and so diagnosis was not obvious, at least back then: 1) lack of respiratory symptoms - not a single cough if I recall correctly -  2) the supposed low prior probability according to official prevalence and 3) lastly because I didn't want to have it and so was satisfied with not experiencing known and obvious symptoms. It first felt like a minor food poisoning but no vomiting or the like. Just felt strange for about two days. Soon these initial symptoms faded and I felt fit again. I went on doing some sport session which by itself went well, but it turned out to have been a bad idea: since in the following days some chills started and accompanied by a temperature increase, up to 36.x from 34.5 - 35 degrees. But since I didn't record the temperature systematically before, the temperature measurements of 36.x degrees were calming instead of ringing the bells. Later on temperature further increased to 37.x accompanied by a strange sticky feeling in the chest; at this point I started to consider Covid as likely.
> Counting everything up it likely was Covid-19 and the sports session likely gave the viruses the opportunity to spread within the lungs. Noteworthy too: before the first symptoms, I had a long day and a rather stressful sleep afterwards, so the immune system likely not had enough time and resources to control the viruses. 
> All in all I should have been more careful and wasn't exemplary in the early and mid phase.
