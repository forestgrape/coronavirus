## Public Description
Covid-19 has different clinical pictures and [symptoms](#immune-response-and-symptoms). The appearances vary since they depend on the [locations](#infection-locations) infected andq SARS-CoV-2 can infect many locations in the respiratory tract except the vocal folds. Therefore any kind of respiratory symptoms - except a hoarse voice - can indicate Covid-19. With such symptoms one should avoid crowded indoor spaces and do a Covid test. 
Many of the symptoms are not specific to Covid-19, they may have other causes than SARS-CoV-2: having a (respiratory) infection with different virus or a bacterium, having eaten/drunken something harmful (e.g. rotten or too much alcohol and the like)or just not having had enough sleep.



## Infections and Diseases

> ##### Disease
> A *disease* is a biological disorder of structure or function in an organism causing inconvenience and/or unwanted effects. Literally disease means without-ease (dis=without, separated from). A disease is often dynamic and an immune response is induced/involved.

Chemical/biochemical damages such as dehydration, a poisoning or physical damage such as a fracture or an injury are not diseases themselves but chemical/physical damage can result from a disease.

There are many different causes of diseases:
* other [life forms](./coronavirus.md#life-form) interfering with the metabolism, such an interference is called [infection as defined below](#virus-infection). 
  * outside of cells but inside multicellular organisms
    * most bacteria
    * fungi
  * inside cells
    * some bacteria
    * all viruses
* immune disease in which the immune system overreacts to substances without need (notes on the immune system in the [Immune System chapter](./immune_system.md))

Virus diseases are cause by virus infections:

> ##### Virus Infection
> A *virus infects* an organism by infecting cells of the organism. A virus infects a cell by entering it and changing/hijacking the cells metabolism to produce virus progeny - called virions. More about viruses and their infections in the chapter [Introduction to Viruses](./coronavirus.md#introduction-to-viruses)

If a virus infection causes lack of ease, one has a virus disease:

> ##### Virus Disease
> A *virus disease* is a [virus infection of an organism](./coronavirus.md#virus-infection) causing adverse effects. 

Adverse effects result either directly through tissue damage caused by viruses or more frequent to keep the body virus free (to prevent future cell/tissue damage) a strong immune response is induced causing effects on its own.

The definition of a virus disease is not strict:  
* Adverse effects or tissue damage are often small and no lack of ease is caused. For most viruses very mild infections are not considered diseases. 
* For viruses which can be highly pathogenic usually one speaks of a disease if there is an infection diagnosed regardless whether there are symptoms or adverse effects.

> ##### Covid-19
> *Covid-19* stands for COronaVIrus Disease 2019. As of December 2020, all SARS-CoV-2 infections are called Covid-19. 

In colloquial language, "Covid-19" is often used synonymously with having SARS-CoV-2 viruses detected in the upper respiratory tract, often tested by nasopharyngeal sampling and PCR testing. However the situation is not that simple:  
* Not all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a detectable amount of viruses in the nose since SARS-CoV-2 can infect the lower respiratory tract only. Especially people with a sensible immune system may experience symptoms without having a detectable viral load in the upper respiratory tract. But it is also possible to have severe Covid-19 without having detectable viruses by nose swabs [citation in work].  
* On the contrary some people have a detectable viral load in the upper respiratory tract but no symptoms. The following terms describe the symptom stage of a person.

More about in the sections [Diagnosis](#diagnosis) and Locations](#infection-locations).

> ##### Symptomatic
> A person experiencing/notifying/showing symptoms of a disease is called symptomatic. 
> ##### Asymptomatic
> A person *not* experiencing/notifying/showing symptoms while having an infection is called asymptomatic.
> ##### Presymptomatic
> Even those person developing symptoms are asymptomatic in the early phase of a disease during these phase a person is called presymptomatic. 

## Disease Factors
A virus disease is an interplay of host factors including the host immune system, the behavior of the virus and of environmental factors.

* __Host Factors__ relevant for the tropism of Covid-19 are
    - Cells susceptible to infection and capable of producing viruses (not all cells are susceptible e.g. red blood cells are not).
    - Host [immune response](#immune-response-and-symptoms).
* __Capabilities and Behavior of the Virus__
  Viruses behave different under different environmental factors (called tropism of viruses), described in the section [Tropism of viruses](./coronavirus.md/tropism). E.g. SARS-2 virions can initiate cell entry only for cells containing a matching receptor. To infect a tissue several conditions must be met as described in the chapter [Tissue Tropism of SARS-CoV-2](./coronavirus.md/#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2).
* __Environmental Factors__
    - the travel of virions between hosts and thus the mode of the initial infection. E.g. in dry air exhaled droplets dry out and these are more likely to be deposited deep in the lungs.
    - Environmental factors can influence the host factors as well as the virus tropism and thus indirectly the course of the disease. E.g.:
      - Very dry air can weaken the immune system of the mucous membrane in the respiratory tract.
      - Dirty air can weaken defence mechanisms against viruses e.g. ciliated cells are damaged and thereby the clearance of particles in the respiratory tract is reduced.



## Infection Locations
SARS-CoV-2 infects different tissues in humans. The effects from the virus infection such as tissue damage and symptoms are often local to the infected locations.

Different topics related to the infection locations are described in the sections:
* The section [Viral Load](#viral-load) describes in which body fluids and tissues how many virions are observed.
* The [Immune Response and Symptoms](#immune-response-and-symptoms) section gives an overview of the different symptoms induced by the infection location.
* On the [coronavirus page](./coronavirus.md), the section [tissue tropism](./coronavirus.md#tissue-tropism-of-sars-cov-2) describes the tissue preferences of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 especially.
* The experimental page [Coronavirus Disease Pattering](./ideas_to_explore/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) describes that coronavirus infections at different locations can be experienced/observed as different diseases.

### Common Infection Location
* Upper Respiratory Tract => Symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases: a sore throat, coughing and a runny nose. Loss of smell or taste.
* Throat => Coughing, the body wants to get rid of the viruses in the respiratory tract.
* Central Bronchi => Dry cough.
* Deep Lungs i.e. small bronchi, alveoli => If the lungs get involved, symptoms can be a strange feeling in the chest like something sticky being inside (dry mucus loaded with viruses) or even shortness of breath (the lungs are inflamed). Diarrhea can both start early and later on and can outlast the respiratory infection by days or even weeks.
* virions in the alveoli and spread to the blood => Early on virions are released into the blood. This feels like it is starting from within. Symptoms can be chills (because the body is increasing the temperature to fight the viruses) or just strange feeling, similar to a weak poisoning when having eaten something rotten or drunken too much. Feeling tired, energy-less and having an increased recovery time after sports are indications too.



## Immune Response and Symptoms
[in work]

### Causes of Symptoms
The symptoms of a [virus disease](#virus-disease) are caused:
1. Direct symptoms through cell damage (rare)
2. Indirect symptoms through the induced [immune response](./immune_system.md) (frequent).

### Localized Symptoms
Coronavirus infections can be localized (especially in the early phase), therefore the symptoms can be local and depend on the locations infected as described in the section [Infection Locations and Symptoms](#infection-location-and-symptoms). 


## Disease Stages
[in work]


## Diagnosis

### History of Covid-19 Diagnosis
* In late 2019 and early 2020 Covid-19 was often diagnosed based on lung CT findings.
* From February 2020 to December 2020 the most used method to diagnose Covid-19, is having a detectable amount of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. The viral load is detected either by [PCR-Test](#pcr-test) or [Antigen-Tests](#antigen-test). In the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemics when the bottleneck was the availability of accurate PCR tests. 
* Late 2020 antigen tests are getting more common.
* 2021? Alternate Locations? [Rethink Diagnosis](#diagnosis-locations)


### Methods to Directly Detect Viruses
In tissues containing infected cells or in the lining fluids protecting/cleaning these tissues the viral load can be measured.
* #### Detect Building Blocks of Viruses
  To detect viruses replicating the building blocks of virions can be searched.
  * ##### PCR Test 
    Test for specific sequences in the genome of virions (positive single stranded RNA for coronaviruses). The amount of virions - called [viral load](#viral-load) - can be determined with high specificity and sensitivity. 
  * ##### Antigen Test
    Methods detecting proteins of virions are usually called antigen tests (virus proteins are called antigens since these proteins can be recognized by the immune system as harmful).
    * There are many different products of antigen tests which vary a lot in sensitivity and specificity.
    * The sensitivity and specificity of antigen tests tend to be lower than PCR based tests for most antigen test kits available as of December 2020.
* #### Detect Metabolism of Coronaviruses
  Temporary RNA produced from coronaviruses with a running metabolism can be detected by [PCR-Tests](#pcr-test).
* #### Detect Infectious Virions
  Samples possibly containing virions can be put on cell or organ cultures. These cell or organ cultures then can be inspected by another methods such as detecting tissue change/damage or detecting RNA to see whether there were infectious virions in the  samples. The samples can be diluted so much that virus colonies originating from single virions can be distinguished. In this  way the number of infectious virions can be determined.


### Methods to Indirectly Detect Viruses
* #### Detect Tissue damage
  * chemical e.g. detecting cell damage by detecting distinctive proteins.
    (-) not specific
  * optical e.g. round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid-19 [in work and to check/specify and cite]
    (+) quite specific in the lung
    (-) in the upper respiratory tract, tissue damage to low
* #### Detect Immune Response
  * #### Antibody Test
    [in work] <!--td: update immune sys page with antibodies>
    For infections triggering certain alarms, the immune response involves antibodies which can be detected in the blood. The antibodies are in the serum of the blood. Methods analyzing the blood serum are called *serology* and often antibody test are referred serological (Covid) tests. There are different kind of antibodies which are produced at different stages during and after an infection. Infections in later stages and past infections can be diagnosed by this method. 


### Diagnosis Locations
Two types of locations are suitable for diagnosis: 
* Tissues with active viral replication ([Infected Locations](#infection-locations))
* Viral Load in body fluids ([Viral Load](#viral-load)) from virus replication in close tissues or deposition. 

The fluids in the respiratory tract are a good locations to detect SARS-CoV-2 virions:
* Since SARS-CoV-2 infects and transmits mainly through the respiratory tract, the respiratory tracts is the place to search
* The virions mostly are released on the apical side and therefore there are virions in the fluids covering infected tissues. 
* For accessibility reasons fluids in the upper respiratory are preferred. However the largest number of susceptible cells to SARS-CoV-2 are in the lower respiratory tract.

Common locations and corresponding methods for diagnosis are:
* [Nasopharyngeal Swabs](#nasopharyngeal-swabs) 
* [Salvia Diagnosis](#salvia-diagnosis)
* [Lung CT](#lung-ct)

#### Nasopharyngeal Swabs
Nasopharyngeal Swabs (NPS) are, as of december 2020, often used as 'gold standard' for Covid-19 diagnosis. NPS samples can be analyzed either by PCR or antigen tests.
(+/-) quite easy to take but trained persons are needed
(+) the sensitivity is good for severe infections.

#### Salvia
Described in the section [Salvia based Diagnosis](#salvia-based-diagnosis).

#### Lung CT
Round glassy occupancies in the lung are characteristic for Covid [to check and cite]
(+) specific
(+) detects infection of the lung regardless whether there are viruses in the upper respiratory tract
(-) radiation exposure for patient
(-) only in diseases involving the lung significantly and thus sensitivity low
=> recommended for symptomatic risk patients of very high age (radiation exposure less relevant) with negative test in the upper respiratory tract


### Challenges regarding Viral Load and Diagnosis
Often investigations for viral load are biased. Reasons are:
* Sampling is biased towards symptomatic patients. Not necessarily bad since symptomatic patients are more infectious ([Section Infectors and Symptoms](./spread_analyses.md#infectors-and-symptoms) in the Chapter Spread Analyses) and more at risk for severe disease.
* Often NPS samples are taking as a 'Gold Standard' to diagnose Covid-19. Measuring viral load e.g. in salvia is often compared to NPS viral load and sometimes NPS sampling is assigned a sensitivity of 100%. 
  > I guess/estimate the sensitivity of NPS testing at a single time point lower than 75%
* E.g. not to every infection in the upper respiratory tract the body responds with antibodies or only antibodies of a specific type. On the other hand a lower respiratory tract infection may yield antibodies, but be negative at a single PCR in the upper respiratory tract.



## Viral Load
[**in work and unfinished**]

> ##### Viral Load
> The *viral load* denotes how many virions are present in specimen of tissue or body fluid.

A viral load is observed in locations with active viral replication. Sometimes a viral load can be detected upon deposition of virions from other infected locations. While the latter is necessary for the initial infection event of a location, the viral load through deposition is often to low to be detected. However often happens local amplification. 


### Local Amplification
While the lung is primarily infected and both responsible for the spread to other persons and the symptoms, there are susceptible cells in the nose and in the salviary glands for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Deposited virions can replicate and so the viral load is amplified in these locations. Therefore the nose mucus or salvia often have a detectable viral load and thus are suitable for diagnosis. 

### Relevance of Viral Load
Knowing the viral load observed in different fluids and tissues is relevant for:
* __Diagnosis__: For an optimal diagnosis location, the viral load is optimally high for the different disease patterns caused by SARS-CoV-2 and taking specimens is easy.  
* __Transmission__: Knowing the viral load in different locations (fluids:relevant for spread and infection and tissues:where the viruses replicate) can help to understand and prevent transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 virions.
* __Understanding Covid-19__: Knowing at which stages which locations are infected by the coronaviruses can help to predict the disease progression and to optimize the treatment. 



### Types of Specimens

#### Body Fluids
Coronaviruses virions are mostly released on the apical surfaces and so the virions in the fluids covering infected cells.

#### Tissues
Since sampling fluids is enough in most cases tissues are rarely collected. Sometimes tissues are analyzed post mortem which show the virus distribution in deadly SARS-CoV-2 infections. 



### Viral Load at different Locations

[in work] A recommended review for the viral load in upper respiratory tract specimens is by [Lee et al](#summary-review-lee).
#### Viral Load in the Mouth 
see [Viral Load in Salvia](#viral-load-in-salvia) in the section [Salvia based Diagnosis](#salvia-based-diagnosis)

#### Posterior Nose Mucus
Is obtained by nasopharyngeal swabs and the most used location for detecting Covid-19 (as of December 2020).
#### Anterior Nose Mucus
[in work]
In the review of  [Lee et al](#summarized-review-lee) some studies investigating the anterior nose mucus are cited.
#### Sputum
[in work]

#### Broncho-alveolar-lavage fluid (BAL)
One of the few locations in the lower respiratory tract which is/can be sampled. Despite the lower respiratory tract is the most relevant location, the viral load in these locations is less known especially for mild cases since sampling is complicated. 

#### Blood

### Tissues
[on todo list]
#### Lung
#### Kidney
#### Intestine
#### Brain




## Salvia based Diagnosis
The salvia based diagnosis has advantages:
* Salvia since easier to sample than the back of the nose and suitable for self collection. 
* The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in salvia mixed with cough up sputum seems to perform as well or even better as NPS (section [Viral Load](#viral-load-locations) and [summary Lee](#summarized-review-lee))

but also challenges:
* The viral load in salvia depends on the exact method and location of sampling (e.g. throat wash, coughing up sputum) and the time taken (e.g. the salvia flow is increased during eating and decreased at night).

### Literature on Salvia for Covid-19 Diagnosis
Reviewed in [Lee et al](#summarized-review-lee) and [da Silva](#summarized-review-dasilva). A recommended read is [Yokota 2](#summary-yokota-2). A recent detailed investigation with 252 positive testees (228 salvia & NPS, 20 NPS only, 4 salvia only) is [Huber](#summary-huber).

### Literature on Salvia for Diagnosis


### Viral Load in Salvia
The viral load in salvia depends on the exact method and location of sampling (e.g. throat wash, coughing up sputum) and the time taken (e.g. the salvia flow is increased during eating and decreased at night). Direct comparison of different sampling procedures for SARS-CoV-2 viral load are not available to my knowledge (as of 29.12.2020), however a

#### Viral Load for different Sampling Procedures
* Throat Wash
* Coughing up Sputum
* Early Morning Salvia
* Adding VTM versus

#### Comparing Sampling Procedures
* Single vs Triple Throat Wash
* Adding VTM vs 
#### Viral Load compared to NPS
The viral load in salvia is similar to the viral load in the nose with an  agreement of about 90%. Since the viral load in salvia depends on the sampling methods, the results obtained in different studies ([Literature](#literature-on-salvia-diagnosis)) vary slightly.



## Fatality Rate
[in work]
The death rate depends on many factors and varies considerably.

The death rate calculation depends on how a Covid-19 infection is [defined](#infections-and-diseases) and [diagnosed](#diagnosis).

> ###### Infection Fatality Rate
> The *infection fatality rate* denotes the proportion how many people die from the infection from all people having the infection. 
> `ifr = #(deaths)/#(all infected)`

> *Fatality rate* on this page is used synonymously to [infection fatality rate](#infection-fatality-rate).

To define and diagnose an infection is not simple as described in [Diseases and Infections](#infections-and-diseases). Acute [Covid-19](#covid-19) is often diagnosed either by PCR test and past Covid-19 by seroprevalence of antibodies. These methods don't agree in all cases: One can have a positive PCR test but no antibodies formation or having antibodies but a negative PCR test in the nose (especially if measured only at a single time point).


> ###### Case Fatality Rate
> The *case fatality rate* denotes the death rate obtained by using the official case counts: `cfr = #deaths/#(official cases)`
 

For Covid-19 the official usually miss the majority of the cases, which yields a cfr fare to high. 
> The relation between cfr can ifr can be exploited to estimate the `detection rate = #(case count)/#(actual infected)` and the hidden cases:  
`cfr/ifr = [#(deaths)/#(all infected)] / [#(deaths)/#(cases count)] = #(case count)/#(all infected) = detection rate`  
(more in the section [Detect Estimates Out of Bounds](./monitoring.md#detect-estimates-out-of-bounds) in the [Monitoring chapter](./monitoring.md)).

### Estimates
[in work]
* John Ioannidis infers the death rate from seroprevalence data across the world. Results:
  * 0.27% is the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate   (0.23% if corrected for the number of antibody types tested (immunoglobin, IgG, IgM, IgA))
  * 0.09% infection-fatality-rate in locations with COVID-19 population-mortality-rates less than the global average (< 118 deaths/million)
  * 0.20% infection-fatality-rate in locations with 118–500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.57% infection-fatality-rate in locations with > 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
  * 0.05% infection-fatality-rate corrected median for people younger than 70 years

A review and meta analysis. Helpful plots showing uniformly the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in NPS/salvia/NS for the reviewed studies and aggregated detection rates for different features (e.g. symptomatic) and different collection methods (NPS/Salvia/NS). 
##### Methods
"We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval October 1st, 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types [saliva, oropharyngeal (OP), and nasal (NS) swabs] versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT)." => "From 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting 15 inclusion criteria."
##### Findings
The results from the different studies/data aggregated by feature are summarized to a figure which shows % positive alternate specimens, % positive NP specimens and (if available) % specimens where both NP and alternate are positive. 
Selected aggregated results, the complete list is found in Figure 2 in the paper. 
* Overall salvia they conclude a detection rate of 88% for salvia and 94% for NPS //both detection rates are likely much lower see Limitations 
* Cough or deep  throat salvia have a detection rate of 94% while NPS have 89%.
* Asymptomatic patients have a detection rate of 87% in salvia and 73% in NPS
* Symptomatic Patients have a detection rate of 88% in salvia and 96% in NPS
##### Limitations
To my checking for some studies NPS are taken as a reference method and assigned a sensitivity of 100% [to confirm and check]. Therefore the detection rates should be interpreted as relative numbers comparing NPS and alternate specimens and not as absolute detection rates.

* "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all 25 patients first salivary swab, with different Ct values (range 18.12–32.23, mean value 27.16 +/− 3.07), but all of them were under the Ct value of 33."
* "Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation between the LDH values recorded in the haematochemical analyses and the Ct values, thus the viral load detected in the saliva was correlated to the tissue damage reported by biomarkers (p = 0.04) (Table 2) (Fig. 1a and b)."
* "In contrast, there was not a significant correlation between usRCT and the Ct values (p = 0.07), but an inverse tendency between this inflammatory index and the viral load detected in saliva (Fig. 1c and d) was observed."

#### Summary Huber


##### Methods
* "Adults and children that qualified for a regular SARS-CoV-2 test according to the FOPH (Swiss federal office of public health) and reported to one of the participating test centers or emergency units were enrolled from October 20, 2020 to November 4, 2020. In total 1187 individuals (male 54.8%/female 45.2%) were included (Table1)." 
* "Participants were either asked to clear the throat thoroughly (“Basic”, N = 835) or in an intensified protocol to clear it three times (“Enhanced”, N = 352) and collect about 0.5 – 1 ml of saliva."
* "In the present study, neither eating, drinking nor smoking was controlled as study subjects came for an elective analysis by NPS and thus could only be informed about the saliva sampling on site immediately before the collection."
*  "Immediately after saliva collection, VTM (virus transport medium) was added to the crude saliva and the content mixed through gentle twisting." 
*  "Saliva was collected directly after NPS and both specimens immediately sent for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing."
##### Results
Salvia\Swab | Swab positive | Swab negative | Total
--|--|--|--
Saliva positive |       228 |           4   |  232 
Salvia negative |        20 |         935   |  955

* "We observed decreasing viral loads with ongoing symptomatic infection in both saliva and NPS, highlighting a transient window of detection in the upper respiratory tract. Interestingly, changes in saliva were overall less dynamic than in NPS (Figure 4B)."
* "In line with a trend to lower viral loads, i.e. higher Ct values in absence of symptoms (asymptomatic median Ct 28.4; mild symptoms median Ct 23.7; strong symptoms median Ct 21.6)"
* "Up to a Ct 33 (equivalent to approximately 26’000 genome copies/ml) in the corresponding NPS, a notably high PPA (97.6%) is reached."

J Clin Microbiol 58:e01946-20. [https:// doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01946-20]()
##### Methods
"An enhanced saliva specimen (i.e., strong sniff, elicited cough, and collection of saliva/secretions) was collected without transport medium prior to collection of NPS from 224 patients with symptoms deemed consistent with COVID-19."
##### Results
216 of the 224 patients had analyzed both samples without errors (9 errors in total).

Salvia\Swab     | Swab positive | Swab negative | Total
--|--|--|--
Saliva positive | 38            | 1             | 39 
Salvia negative |  0            | 177           | 177
Total           | 38            | 178           | 216 

###### Notes
* "The overall mean (SD) CT value for the positive NPS specimens was 20.55 (5.36) cycles, whereas the corresponding overall mean (SD) CT value for enhanced saliva specimens was 24.16 (4.80) cycles, for a mean difference in CT value for paired NPS and saliva specimens of -3.61 (95% CI, -5.78 to -1.44; P = 0.002)."
* "There was little correlation between the CT values (i.e., viral loads) of the positive saliva and NPS specimens (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.162; P = 0.333) (Fig. 1C)."


#### Summary Williams
**Saliva as a non-invasive specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2**
##### Methods
* Between 25th March and 1st April 2020 in Melbourne, 622 patients provided NPS samples, 522 of those 622 patients provided saliva and NPS samples for Covid-19 tests. 
* Patients were asked to pool saliva in their mouth for 1-2 minutes prior to collection.
##### Results
* 39 of 622 (6.3%) patients had PCR-positive NPS, and 33 of those 39 (84.6% of NPS positive) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in saliva.
* 1 positive of 50 (2%) salvia samples of patients whose NPS sample was negative.
##### Limitations
Data not uniform/consistent:
* Of the 622 patients with NPS samples only 522 provided salvia samples (but not written if the positive 39 belonged to the 522).
* Only 50 salvia samples of those tested negative by NPS were analyzed.

Mass screening of asymptomatic persons for SARS-CoV-2 using saliva. Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, ciaa1388. Advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1388
##### Methods
Individuals from two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort had specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples analyzed by PCR.
##### Results
"In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence at 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva."

###### Contact Tracing Cohort

--|--|--|--
Saliva positive | 38        | 6      |  44 
Salvia negative |  3        | 114    | 117
Total           | 41        | 120    | 161

###### Airport Quarantine cohort
Salvia\Swab | NPS positive | NPS negative | Total
--|--|--|--
Saliva positive |  4        | 0      | 4 
Salvia negative |  1        | 1758   | 1759
Total           |  5        | 1758   | 1763 

##### Conclusion
"Both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity. Self- collected saliva is a valuable specimen to detect SARS-CoV-2 in mass screening of asymptomatic persons."

#### Summary Zhou
**SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Upper Respiratory Specimens of Infected Patients**
#### Methods
"We analyzed the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients in relation to day of onset of any symptoms (Fig. 1C)." 
#### Results
* "Higher viral loads (inversely related to Ct value) were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat." 
* "Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza4 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV."
* "The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients."
* The nasal and throat swabs of many patients don't have single local maxima but several. Moreover they can reach 0 one day and be positive the next day. //=> to exclude infection several negative samples are needed.

## Appendix
> #### Personal Covid Experience
> I likely had Covid-19 myself in early to mid March 2020 when temperatures were still about -10 degree Celsius in my area. For me the initial experience was very different from a common respiratory disease and so diagnosis was not obvious, at least back then: 1) lack of respiratory symptoms - not a single cough if I recall correctly -  2) the supposed low prior probability according to official prevalence and 3) because I didn't want to have it and so was satisfied with not experiencing known and obvious symptoms. It first felt like a minor food poisoning but no vomiting or the like. Just felt strange for about two days. Soon these initial symptoms faded and I felt fit again. I went on doing some sport session. During the sport session I felt fit, but it turned out to have been a bad idea: The following days some chills started and accompanied by a temperature increase, up to 36.x from my normal 35 degrees. But since I didn't record the temperature systematically before, the temperature measurements of 36.x degrees were calming instead of ringing the bells. Later the temperature further increased to 37.x accompanied by a strange sticky feeling in the chest; at this point I started to consider Covid as likely.
> Counting everything up it likely was Covid-19 and the sports session likely gave the viruses the opportunity to spread within the lungs. Noteworthy too: The day before the first symptoms was long and rather stressful, so the immune system likely wasn't prepared well to control the viruses initially. But it then reacted timely: from the likely infection event (somebody coughing roughly 4 meters away in the same room and I was there for about 1 hour) to feeling strange is was less than twelve hours.
