### Salvia

#### Azzi
##### Methods
Analyze salivary samples of 25 patients with severe COVID-19 by rRT-PCR.
##### Results
* "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all 25 patients first salivary swab, with different Ct values (range 18.12–32.23, mean value 27.16 +/− 3.07), but all of them were under the Ct value of 33."
* "Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation between the LDH values recorded in the haematochemical analyses and the Ct values, thus the viral load detected in the saliva was correlated to the tissue damage reported by biomarkers (p = 0.04) (Table 2) (Fig. 1a and b)."
* "In contrast, there was not a significant correlation between usRCT and the Ct values (p = 0.07), but an inverse tendency between this inflammatory index and the viral load detected in saliva (Fig. 1c and d) was observed."
* "A striking feature was highlighted in two patients who showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar swabs proved to be negative."

**Saliva as a possible tool for the SARS-CoV-2 detection: A review**

Helpful summaries of 39 studies analyzing the viral load in salvia. 
##### Methods
Search for (“saliva”) and (“SARS-CoV-2” or “coronavirus” or “COVID-1”) in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus yielded:
"A total of 363 studies were identified by  and 39 were selected for review."
##### Key findings
* In most studies saliva samples yielded a viral load similar as NPS samples. 
* For most studies: When NPS samples were positive salvia samples were positive in over 70% of the cases. 
* For most studies: When salvia samples were positive NPS samples were positive Salivary samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection was as consistent and sensitive as the nasopharyngeal swabs in most studies, having been effective in detecting asymptomatic infections previously tested negative in nasopharyngeal samples."

#### Iwasaki
##### Methods
Analyzed the viral nasopharyngeal and saliva samples in 76 patients.
##### Results
* 8 patients were positive for both salvia and nasopharyngeal probes. 1 patient for salvia only and 1 for nasopharyngeal only. 
* A weak tendency for salvia samples to be higher early and nasopharyngeal to be higher later phase of Covid-19 was observed.

**Comparison of saliva and oro-nasopharyngeal swab sample in the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19**
##### Methods 
Three groups of patients are analyzed:
* "Group 1 (30 patients): Hospitalized patients with a finding consistent with COVID-19 in the CT scan of the lung and detected SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in at least one ONS sample."
* "Group 2 (15 patients): Hospitalized patients with a finding compatible with COVID-19 in lung CT examination, but in whom SARS-CoV-2 were not detected in at least two ONS samples by PCR."
* "Group 3 (19 patients): Patients who present to the emergency department with complaints compatible with COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath) but have normal CT."
##### Results
* Group 1: Saliva samples were positive in 21 (70%) of the 30 patients in Group 1. All ONS samples by group construction. 
* Group 2: Two salvia samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. No positive ONS samples by group construction.
* Group 3: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the saliva of two patients, and only in ONS of one patient.

**A direct comparison of enhanced saliva to nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients.** 
J Clin Microbiol 58:e01946-20. https:// doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01946-20.
##### Methods
"An enhanced saliva specimen (i.e., strong sniff, elicited cough, and collection of saliva/secretions) was collected without transport medium prior to collection of NPS from 224 patients with symptoms deemed consistent with COVID- 19."
##### Results
For 216 of the 224 patients had analyzed both samples without errors (9 errors in total).

Salvia\Swab | Swab positive | Swab negative | Total
--|--|--|--
Saliva positive | 38        | 1             | 39 
Salvia negative |  0        | 177           | 177
Total           | 38        | 178           | 216 

###### Notes
* "The overall mean (SD) CT value for the positive NPS specimens was 20.55 (5.36) cycles, whereas the corresponding overall mean (SD) CT value for enhanced saliva specimens was 24.16 (4.80) cycles, for a mean difference in CT value for paired NPS and saliva specimens of -3.61 (95% CI, -5.78 to -1.44; P = 0.002)."
* "There was little correlation between the CT values (i.e., viral loads) of the positive saliva and NPS specimens (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.162; P = 0.333) (Fig. 1C)."


#### Williams
**Saliva as a non-invasive specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2**
##### Methods
* Between 25th March and 1st April 2020 in Melbourne, 622 patients provided NPS samples, 522 of those 622 patients provided saliva and NPS samples for Covid-19 tests. 
* Patients were asked to pool saliva in their mouth for 1-2 minutes prior to collection.
##### Results
* 39 of 622 (6.3%) patients had PCR-positive NPS, and 33 of those 39 (84.6% of NPS positive) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in saliva.
* 1 positive of 50 (2%) salvia samples of patients whose NPS sample was negative.
##### Limitations
Somewhat messy because not all of the patients had salvia collected and moreover not all salvia samples have been analyzed:
* Only 522 of 622 provided salvia samples (but not written if the positive 39 belonged to the 522).
* Only 50 salvia samples of all those negative with negative NPS were analyzed.

**Saliva is a reliable, non-invasive specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection**
##### Methods
155 Participants with signs/symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and/or oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and saliva collection in Salvador, Brazil. 
##### Results
Salvia\Swab | Swab positive | Swab negative | Total
--|--|--|--
Saliva positive | 67 (43.%) | 2 (1.3%)  | 69 (44.5%)
Salvia negative |   4 (2.6%) | 82 (52.9%)| 86 (55.5%)
Total           | 71 (45.8%)   | 84 (54.2%)   |155 (100%)
