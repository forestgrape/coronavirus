## Recent Topics Added
- 23.3. [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment: It reduces the number of infectious virions and enhances the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
- 23.3. Proposal of [Local Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)


## Recent Updates
- 25.4. Page coronaviruses separated into the pages:
  - [Life Forms](2_biological/life-forms.md). Principles and concepts of life on earth.
  - [Viruses](2_biological/viruses.md). What viruses are and what they can do and do.
  - [Coronaviruses](2_biological/coronavirus.md). Life cycle, distinguishing features and capabilities of coronaviruses.
  - [Motion](./2_biological/motion.md) How life form move or get moved to cross distances.
- 25.4. Clarifications on Comments: For conciseness all subjective and off topic remarks are formatted as [comment](#comments). Exception in context of Covid symptoms I mentioned transparency is important, but I also meant overall transparency - marked as comment now. There was a section was titled 'orientation matters' - describing that the cell orientation is relevant for coronavirus infection - this was not marked as comment and accordingly there was no second meaning in this case as stated in [comment on comments](#comment-on-comments). 
  > Orientations in the sense of attitudes or group membership, - in my view - *only* matter if relevant for the topic of interest. Often they are not relevant.
- 1.4. - 25.4. Formulations across the pages. E.g. added note that allowing and promoting outdoor activities often not only reduces the burden of Covid measures but often also help reducing severe Covid cases since less time is spent indoors and the lifestyles are healthier. Specified [support for closed businesses](7_social/controlling.md#support-for-individuals-and-businesses). 
- 1.4. Propelling Spikes: How coronaviruses use their spike proteins as propellors to fly around. Anytime they can move in all directions since their spikes are around the spherical virions. (special note consisting only of this two sentences). 
- 29.3. Navigation bar with table of contents added. Layout adaptions to place the navbar.
- 24.3. Regrouping [content](#content) into (currently) 8 topics both as files on github and content on github pages.
- 23.3. Clarified summary for [Virion Viability](2_biological/virion_viability.md). [A table with compiled data](./2_biological/virion_viability/viability_data.md) from viability experiments is online.

## Notes on Reading
* Many parts are __hypothesis__ and __ideas__ but __not__ [double] checked facts. They are put here as ideas to be checked and evaluated. 
* Chapters with new or not well founded content are tagged with *(explorative)*.
* This page often conversational and some parts aren't rigorous and just ideas in raw form. 
* The page is in work. Parts under heavy work are mostly marked with '[in work]'. Mistakes of any form are likely.
* _License_ The license is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. Relaxation: For any use with the main purpose of public health and public information no attribution is needed (as long as its not copy & paste). <!-- in science citing/Referencing is a good and helpful practice.-->
* _Support_ [Support on ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/H2H72F6XY) is welcome, to enable full-time re-searching on coronaviruses.
* Questions, pointing out mistakes, improvement suggestions and feedback are __welcome__ (witotraub@gmail.com, witotraub@runbox.com).
* _[Table of Content](#content)_ The content is ordered mostly by dependencies i.e. content founding other sections is ahead. The dependencies are often circular however.
* _Source_ This page is open source on GitHub: [https://github.com/forestgrape/coronavirus/blob/master/index.md](https://github.com/forestgrape/coronavirus/blob/master/index.md), where it can be read both as Markdown and GitHub Preview and hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://forestgrape.github.io/coronavirus](https://forestgrape.github.io/coronavirus)
* _References_
  * Often references are summarized. Word-by-word extracts are in "_ _ _". The summaries are biased towards to results relevant for this page. To capture the essence of the research is tried too.
  * As much as possible original work is referred. Sometimes reviews or remarks in introductions are referred which point further to the original work/articles.
  * The references are named by the first author. (In the beginning of this work sometimes references were named by the correspondence author or a descriptive tag).
  * References are usually grouped by topic. If several topics apply, one is chosen.

*   > ###### Definitions
    > *Definitions* are written like this and are valid throughout this page; sometimes only throughout this page. Redefinition of existing terms is not done on purpose, unless explicitly noted. Please point out!

*   > ###### Comments
    > *Comments*, often subjective, are formatted the same as [definitions](#definitions) and sometimes additionally marked with programming style '//'. Otherwise distinction is done by context/content.

    > ###### Comment on Comments
    > Subjective or off topic remarks are formatted as comments, if not the formulations are about the topic alone.
    > A section on the coronavirus page - with the content that Coronaviruses enter and leave cell preferable from the cell side pointing outwards (apical side) - was titled 'Orientation matters' for quite a long time and in the same section I had written McCray & Co instead of McCray et al. Both formulations I choose because of a 'cool' sound. The section is and was not marked as subjective accordingly I didn't intend any ambiguity.
    > * The word orientation was used in the sense of positioning  (google-scholar shows quite a few results with 'orientation matters' and most are about physics and also the oxford dictionary lists 'position' as the first meaning).  However, I acknowledge, that orientation is used in different contexts and depending on the background, what one thinks when reading 'orientation' can vary - in social contexts, orientation is often used to denote attitudes or sexual orientation. 
    > * McCray & Co does *not* imply that the research is business focussed (showing and interpreting the results to highlight the benefits of a product instead of an unbiased analysis of the topic), it is outstanding and shows a basics principle of betacoronavirus, namely they mostly live on the surfaces and not within tissues.

    > In my opinion, orientations in the sense of attitudes should *only* matter if important for the topic of interest (e.g. sexual orientation usually matters for dating or sport preferences for sport friends). 
    
    > For a virus infecting a cell the orientation is usually not relevant, however it is relevant for coronaviruses infecting cells in the respiratory tract.

## Content

> Sometimes out of date, newest sections are announced in [recent updates](#recent-updates)].


### Introductory Topics
* [Recent Updates](#recent-updates) and [Update History](./1_introduction/update_history.md)
* [Public Suggestions and Tips](./1_introduction/suggestions_and_tips.md)
    Keep distance and hygiene. Then outdoors is safe. Inside ventilate well and/or wear a mask. Transmission can be smoke-like. Don't burden the immune system.


### Biological Topics
- [Life Forms](2_biological/life-forms.md). Principles and concepts of life on earth.
  - [Motion](./2_biological/motion.md) How life form move or get moved to cross distances.
- [Viruses](2_biological/viruses.md). What viruses are and what they can do and do. Viruses are defined as life forms which are dependent on extern enzymes. Aspects such as life cycle and behavior are discussed.
  - [Virion Viability](./2_biological/virion_viability.md)
    * Virions decay fast in sunlight, soap and disinfectants (the halflife time is a few minutes).
    * From 0 to 40 degrees the decay is faster at increased temperature and depends on the biochemical environment. In saliva, nasal mucus and sputum the halflife time is about 8 hours at 4 degrees and about 2 hours at a room-temperature of 22 degrees.
    * Above 45 degrees the decay fastens and is less dependent on the biochemical environment since the spring-loaded proteins loose their energy.
    * A fast decay seems to occur in the presence of osmotic pressure e.g. when the concentration of salts is very low in the surrounding water. This is the case in distilled water and in situations with a lot of condensation.
- [Coronaviruses](2_biological/coronavirus.md). Life cycle, distinguishing features and capabilities of coronaviruses.
  - [Backtracing Sars-CoV-1/2](./2_biological/hosts_of_nidovirales.md#backtracing-sars-cov-12) (*explorative*)
    The natural habitat of SARS-CoV-1/2 includes domestic animals and insects in the region Northern Yunnan. The life cycle of SARS-like is alternating in hosts and follows nutrient cycles. 


### Medical Topics
* [Covid-19](3_medical/covid19.md)
    The Covid-19 results from the interplay between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 can infect different locations throughout the respiratory tract and  the immune response experienced depends on the location. Therefore Covid-19 is a disease with many faces. 
* [Diagnosis and Viral Load](3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) How to diagnose Covid with a focus on methods detecting parts of viruses (virus RNA with PCR or virus proteins with antigen test) at different locations (e.g. in the nose, mouth, lungs).
- [Infection Locations and Disease Patterns](./3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) (*explorative*)


### Immunological Topics
* [Immune System](4_immunological/immune_system.md)
  Selected topics of the immune protection with a focus protection versus coronaviruses are discussed. 
* [Immune Evasion](4_immunological/immune_evasion.md) How coronaviruses circumvent immune system obstacles.


### Epidemiological Topics 
* [Transmission of Sars-CoV-2 with Focus on a Proposed Dry Form Transmission](./5_epidemiological/transmission.md)
    Sars-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted airborne and even a Dry Form aerosol infection is possible.
    - A summary of airborne transmission, 
    - Proposal of a new dry from transmission model,
    - describe how particles behave in the respiratory tract,
    - analyse spread pattern of Covid-19 which indicate aerosol transmission
    - and based on the discussions protection measures are suggested: smoke protection and masks.
- [Spread Analyses](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) Situations where Covid-19 spreading is observed or is *not* observed are described. High transmission of severe Covid is observed in situations where much air is exchanged between people. Much air is exchanged when spending a lot time indoors without ventilation, crowded confined settings, at high altitude and when deep breathing (e.g. sports, singing).

- [Topical Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to prevent and cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses (and other respiratory viruses) live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)
  - [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment: It reduces the number of infectious virions and enhances the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
  - [Increase the mucus Flow by humidified air](./6_prevention_and_treatment/increasing_the_mucus_flow.md): Humidify inhaled air early on to increase the mucus flow and wash the virions out. The goal is a reduce viral load and better prognosis. (explorative)


### Social Topics
* [Thoughts about Controlling Sars-CoV-2](7_social/controlling.md)
    Thoughts how to tackle and control Covid-19. Different kind of measures are discussed from physical (mask, ventilation) to social measures such as an early closure of nightlife.


### Data Topics
* [Monitoring](8_data/monitoring.md)
    About testing, monitoring, gathering and publishing data.
