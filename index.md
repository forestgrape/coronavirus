## Updates
All updates regarding the current Covid Situation here. 
Larger updates here, smaller updates are noted in the section [Minor Updates](#minor-updates) below.

- 22.3. [Spread Assumptions section](./controlling.md#spread-assumptions) on the [controlling page](./controlling.md) added. Formulations across the page.
- 18.3. [Virion Viability Page](./virion_viability.md) in online work (finally!). 
    * Virions decay fast in sunlight, soap and disinfectants (the halflife time is a few minutes).
    * From 0 to 40 degrees the decay is faster at increased temperature and depends on the biochemical environment. In saliva, nasal mucus and sputum the halflife time is about 8 hours at 4 degrees and about 2 hours at a room-temperature of 22 degrees, especially at air humidities around 40%. In dry air or high but not very high humidity the decay is slower.
    * Above 45 degrees the decay fastens (doubling about every 2 degrees) due to the spring-loaded proteins (spikes and sometimes N) loosing their structure and thereby the stored energy.
    
- 17.2. [Masks](./masks.md) now on separate page (moved from controlling). Added section about [Personal Mask Preferences](./masks#personal-mask-preferences)
- 14./15.2 [Diagnosis and Viral Load page](./diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) updated (mainly clarified & formulations improved).
- 13.2. How Coronaviruses overcome Immune System obstacles moved to separate page [Immune Evasion](./immune_evasion.md). [References and a more detailed description in work.]. Clarifications how [coronaviruses get activated](./coronavirus.md#virion-activation) on the [coronavirus page](./coronavirus.md). 
- 11.2. Corrected mistakes (T Cell Training) on the [Immune System page](./immune_system.md) and added/completed section how SARS-2 overcomes antibodies.
- 11.2. Formulations and clarifications across the page.
- 11.2. Movement benefits to overcome Covid moved to own page [Movement](./movement.md). Extension and citations coming the next days.
- 2.2. How [Movement](./covid19.md#movement) helps to produce a good immune response and helps recovering from Covid on the [Covid-19 page](./covid19.md).
- 2.2. Many small updates and clarifications across the page. E.g. added the importance of ventilation of stairwells in [large buildings](./controlling.md#large-buildings) on the Controlling page.

> ### A word of Caution regarding Vaccines (28.1., updated 14.2.)
> What worries me most at the moment is the vaccination rushes and races. It is great and an extraordinary achievement to have vaccines and vaccination programs are well organized. It increases the safety and life quality for people at risk for severe Covid-19. Regarding vaccine recommendations the known and the unknown are important:
> * What has been shown for the approved vaccines is, that they efficiently prevent Covid-19 with typical symptoms combined with positive NPS PCR test and severe Covid-19 at tolerable reactogenicity (typical vaccine side effects). 
> * What is mostly unknown/not investigated/not published are adverse effects such as immune system disorders or long-term effects. Especially in view of vaccinating young people, timely investigations/estimates (long-term) and publishing is needed. Both effects are less a concern for inactivated virus vaccines or other protein based vaccines as long as the adjuvants are harmless (which is not always sure e.g. the safety profile of aluminum is surprisingly unclear despite being in use for 90 years.). For other technologies the effects depend on the exact specifications. RNA vaccines are in general __not__ comparable to protein only vaccines (mRNA vaccines do produce proteins but they thereby often [likely always, to check] mess around with the depths of eukaryotic life. This induces a strong immune response with antibodies, stronger than for proteins alone).
> * There are open questions how  SARS-CoV-2 infections are changed apart from reducing typical/severe Covid-19: The effects of vaccines on virus shedding, virus evolution (both point mutations and recombination) and changed pathogenesis are mostly unknown/not investigated/unpublished.
>  
> An unbiased discussion is missing since many risks ignored and unknown risks are dismissed as not possible. 
> In my opinion, for the time being, the vaccines should be used as the evaluations published show clear benefits: For seronegative and PCR negative people at risk for severe Covid. If it turns out, that the benefits outweigh the risks, summer would be a good time to vaccine many/those not at risk.

- 22.12.-23.1. [Diagnosis and Viral Load](./diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) (before 18.1. on the Covid19 page). 
  - Repeated morning saliva and sputum have a reliable viral load which predicts the disease progression. 
  - Nose swabs have a detection rate of about 60% and the viral load does not predict disease progression.
  -  Experiences from HongKong (Summary [Wong](./diagnosis_and_viral_load.md#summary-wong)) and an investigation from Dubai [Summary Senok](./diagnosis_and_viral_load.md#summary-senok).
  
- 17.1. Improvements and clarifications across the page. Respelled Salvia to Saliva. 
- 22.12. [Covid-19](./covid19.md) redone. New sections about Diagnosis and Viral Load in online work - saliva has a similar sensitivity as nose samples. moved see 17.1.21
- 30.11. [Corona Conform Skiing](./controlling.md#corona-conform-skiing) on the page [Controlling](./controlling.md)
    > Motivated by current discussions and recent personal experience. 
- 24.11. New Page on [Economics](./economics.md): The proposal is to provide universal capital services (e.g. credits) instead of providing targeted support in different situations/crisis (e.g. the current Covid situation). Goals are:
  - Everyone in need can redesign and reorganize their (economic) life in any situation.
  - Making the economic system more fair in the sense that everyone has the opportunity to choose the economic way of life.
- 9.11. Formulations corrected and improved.
  > I spend more time on reading and analyzing than on formulations and proof reading. Although I try, sometimes words are not weighted carefully and it can take a couple of days to discover & improve unworldly formulations.
- 7.11. Updates in [Spread Analyses](./spread_analyses.md) in work:
  - [Infector Distribution](./spread_analyses.md#infector-distribution): 20% of infected were responsible for 80% of the transmissions detected by the contact tracing in Hong Kong.
  - Section on [Pre-symptomatic Infectors](./spread_analyses.md#pre-symptomatic-infectors) in work
- 6.11. Renamed ~~"Monitor Failure"~~ to [Estimates Out of Bounds](./monitor_and_control.md#detect-estimates-out-of-bounds). Case numbers are case numbers and not estimates.
    > Mainly I was shocked by the very steep increase of deaths and still am [analyses in work]. Even though I spent/d a lot of time learning to analyse. 
- 5./6.11. Updates in [Spread Analyses](./spread_analyses.md) in online work:
    * Evidence for super-spreader events at large scale sporting events with spectators. Evidence: 1) players are more frequently infected in regions with spectators and 2) there seem to be increased infection rates in the stadiums catchment areas.
      > Not proven yet but evidence strong enough that risk regions should **stop allowing large scale events** even with protection measures. As of 4./5.11. there still seem to be football matches with many thousand spectators.
    * Sections about observed spreading events in food production factories and airplanes.
- 1.11. [Strategy](./controlling.md#strategy) and [On Numbers](./monitoring.md#on-numbers) sections, where I give my point of view how to tackle Covid and for actions at different incidence levels.
- 31.10. [Detect Monitor Out of Bounds](./monitor_and_control.md#detect-monitor-out-of-bounds) in the extended section [Monitor Prevalence](./monitor_and_control.md#monitor-prevalence) describes how to check estimates in the past: The current death rate multiplied by 400 (inverse fatality) should be about the case estimated a few weeks ago.
- 28.10. (only summaries available) Early results from [Spread Analyses](./spread_analyses.md) show that the Covid-19 transmission probability increases with the amount of air exchanged between people. Air exchange is high when indoors (either heated or air-conditioned) and at increased breathing (high altitude, sport, singing). This strongly indicates that [aerosol](./transmission.md#summary-airborne-transmission) transmission plays a key role. Thus good ventilation, less populated and good and clean mask help indoors and being outside with some distance is safe.
    > During the summer droplet transmission seemed most important, because of Covid-19 waves in regions where the sun was high combined with some research indicating that aerosol transmission is rare in humid and warm settings. Steep increase in Europa as climate cooled in October 2020 combined with extensive droplet preventions in place questioned the dominance of droplet transmission. Reconsideration and a detailed look show: The Covid waves, when the sun is high, occurred/occur either in hot areas and are well explained by air-conditioning or by high altitude:
    * Air-conditioning: Brazil, Middle East and Southern US (in California noteworthy is the difference between hot Los Angeles and temperate San Francisco)
    * High altitudes which means cold nights and increased breathing: La Paz in Bolivia, Quito in Ecuador and Bogota in Columbia or at high altitude combined with heat: Mexico City and currently (28.10.) in Kenya.
- 25.10. New page [Spread Analyses](./spread_analyses.md) in work: Observations and analysis how Covid-19 spreads in different settings.
-  > 24.10. Part of the early-online-updates below (16.10.) is a note about [corona conform schooling](./monitor_and_control.md#corona-conform-schooling) which needed correction: Pupils are **not** likely to play a major role in the past and current Covid spread while protection measures are in place.
-  15./16.10. Early Online Update for the sections [Protection Measures](./monitor_and_control.md#thoughts-about-social-measures) and [Transmission](./transmission.md) in online work. Due to steep increase of cases in Europe and new pieces of evidence regarding transmission.
    > The steep increases despite protection measures in place is noteworthy, since it indicates many hidden/undetected cases.
- 5.10./6.10. moved from literal single-page (all content in index.md) to multiple pages. Pages including short description are in the in the [content](#content). 
  > Even though I liked the single page version since it acknowledges the connections, multi-page is simpler to manage and easier to make the topics as self-contained as possible.
- 21.9. new section [Backtracing Sars-CoV-1/2](#backtracing-sars-cov-12)
- 30.7. Updates and corrections across the page in work/in the process of writing down:
	* I wrongly ignored upper respiratory infections for a long time (because most hospitalized/severe cases were/are in the lungs) -> [Disease patterns](#infection-tropism-and-diseas-patterns)
	* In the first months Sars-CoV-2 didn't have the ability to spread well in humid climate. This has changed: the currently circulating strains spread well in humid climate too.  
- 27.7. [Disease pattering](#infection-tropism-and-disease-patterns)
- 29.4/3.5. Reordering of content and new Sections 'Coronaviruses with a Focus on Sars-CoV-2' and 'Immune Protection with a Focus on Coronaviruses' 
- 17.4.20 00:04 GMT  New section online: Evidence for Increased Immune Protection against Sars-CoV-2 from Exposure to BCoVs
- 9.4.20 Extended section [Prevent Early On Mucus Accumulations](#early-vents), previously named Early On Ventilators 
- 4.4.20 Added Section Ideas to Explore
    - starting with [Early On Ventilators](#early-vents): Increase the mucus flow and clearance by humidified air early on,  to decrease the risk for developing ARDS. 
- 25-30.3/9.4.20:  Corrected and looked up aerosol/particulate inhalation which yields to the new section [Particles in the Respiratory Tract](./transmission.md##particle-dynamics-in-the-respiratory-tract).
    In the first version, I had written that aerosols don't enter the lungs. False. Aerosols DO enter the lungs. The train of thought yielding this mistake: Entering the lungs is halfway entering the body. So there must have been enough evolutionary pressure to prevent this. This is ~~double~~ triple wrong:
    1. The evolutionary roots of the lungs are the alimentary system (some dozens millions of generations ago), so substances coming in were just cleared down. Even as the lungs and the alimentary separated this process stayed. As we often do too, evolution usually gradually bends things right, rather than rebuilding from scratch.  
    2. The lungs developed before we were upright (just a couple of hundred thousand generations ago) and in the original case the clearance of aerosols is earlier and better; shown for mice in [Kleinstreuer](./transmission.md#kleinstreuer-2018). Ciliate based movement works even uphill, as ski tourers know. But there are limits. A gradual adaption evolved first, the oscillation frequency of the cilia increased, but wasn't yet enough so a workaround evolved:  smallest particulates are cleared by macrophages [citation to be added].
    3. Upright clearance evolved when we all were in warm and mostly humid parts of Africa (well it likely got a little drier in the winter months and savanna replaced rainforest in East Africa, so we had motivation to stand up more and more). In such humid environments, clearance works better. In evolutionary dimensions, there has been only a short time for the adaption to cold and dry climate (how much depends on the overall drive for adaption, which isn't straight forward to say since migration routes have twists, crossings and turns, desert nights tend to be cold around the world and lifestyles were and are different). To a permanent stay in heated indoor spaces, there has been and no genetic adaption at all.

## Public Suggestions and Tips

[in rework]
Covid-19 can be serious in the short-term and such serious infections can sometimes damage organs. For less virulent Covid-19, *no* serious long-term effects are known yet, but experiences and research are limited and so whether such effects can occur is *unknown*. Though long-term adverse effects are possible too for other viruses causing subtle infections e.g. common colds. *Awareness* for viruses and *knowledge* what they do and how they can harm or help is important. No reason to be afraid or panic however, unlike viruses we've got a mind, better communication and a superb body police called immune system. The immune system is crucial since completely avoiding viruses is _not_ possible. Viruses can be harmful, but mostly the immune system handles them and they even can support us evolving. 

> Regarding effects: short-term and long-term, adverse and beneficial, unwanted and wanted effects are known and even proven for many things and behaviors, so its about setting priorities. Ideally we all - if we want - are capable to take own educated decisions on priorities or at least can be contributing to decisions. 

> Trying to contribute to knowledge and explain knowledge on coronaviruses is a major motivation for this page.
 
Time to act mindfully, carefully and circumspectly & work together in an open, fair and honest way. 


### Sars-CoV-2 Transmission 
SARS-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted through the air, either by droplets (virions in water droplets flying like balls) or by aerosol (the virions move with the air). For Covid-19 aerosol transmission is more frequent and much more dangerous. A short overview below and a more in depth description is in the section [Airborne Transmission](./transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission).
* __Droplet Transmission__: Droplets fly in trajectories similar to balls thrown. How fare they fly depends on the initial movement: when coughing or sneezing they fly farther than when talking. Transmission risk is in situation when bad breath/reek of alcohol is smelled. Droplet can be exchanged when close range face-to-face talking and this gives a transmission opportunity. Prevent
    - Masks
    - Distance
    - Side-a-side instead of face-to-face
    - Plexiglas
* __Aerosols Transmission__: Aerosols behave soot/dust-like. Aerosol transmission occurs mainly in heated indoor rooms: the cooler outside the drier in heated indoor rooms and the likelier aerosol transmission. Aerosol transmission is hard to completely prevent, but it can be efficiently reduced:
    - being outside, ventilation, distance and less people inside 
    - masks, preferably with a good fit and [filter](./monitor_and_control.md#mask-types) and changed/cleaned frequently
    - if possibly infected (e.g. having any kind of respiratory symptoms) staying home and *out* of foreign indoor rooms 

    Keeping the smoke model in mind makes it easier to detect and avoid situations with aerosol transmission: 
    - Just smelling smoke is the theoretical possibility of infection. Being that exposed to smoke that the cloth start smelling, likely corresponds to a probability of a few percentages to get infected.  
    - A neighbors candle won't harm through doors, but in a place with an indoor barbecue, smoke travels to the next floor. For Covid-19 this means: A single neighbor being infected is no risk, but in place with possibly many infected people e.g. a hospital treating Covid-19 patients, wearing a mask in _all_ rooms is important. 


### How to Reduce Covid-19 Infection Paths
> Remark: The following advices were written mostly in early spring 2020 when Sars-Cov-2 induced ARDS/SARS disease patterns peaked in Europe. Updates in work.  

In brief: Think ahead. To reduce the infection possibilities keep some distance or wear a mask and prefer fresh air. 

* #### Outside
    [Outside is safe, if some distance is kept](./control.md#outside-is-safer). Ideally, walk or cycle directly from home. Outside most infection occur when close range face-to-face talking. In heated and few ventilated regions, beware the corridor and stairwell, don't stay too long or wear a mask. 

* #### Ventilate
    [Ventilation](./control.md#ventilation) has been shown to be effective to reduce airborne virus spread. 
    * Open the windows. In cold climate: ventilate the rooms regularly by opening all windows for 5 minutes.  
    * If possibly infected, ventilate before opening the door of your room or flat. 

* #### Masks
    Wear a [mask](./control.md#masks) 
    - Outdoor and indoor: for close range face-to-face contact/talking. 
    - In indoor places where susceptible or infectious people can be.  The longer one stays, the more people there are and the less ventilation there is, the more important. This because the infection risk increases with the amount of indoor air breathed.

    The mask should be clean/fresh, have a good fit and a good filter. In some situation high-filtration is especially important: in hospitals and if one is possible infected. But if symptomatic staying home or at least at of crowds is crucial, since masks may reduce spread but do not prevent it. The same is true for all other prevention measures such as distancing and hygiene, they reduce but do not prevent spread. 

    Masks can be reused if [cleaned](./control.md#mask-reuse-and-cleaning) regularly. From time to time it should changed or washed thoroughly - there's more than Sars-CoV-2, that's not to forget!

* #### Distancing
    Distancing reduces infection risk.

* #### No Dry Air
     In dry air, both dust and viruses stay longer in the air. Dry air also reduces the defences of the respiratory tract against pathogens. In areas with indoor heating, drying the frequently washed cloths inside keeps the air humid. 

* #### Hygiene
    Keep proper hygiene. Especially wash hands before eating and after toilet. Soap destroys coronaviruses. Hygiene is important because:
    * Transmission pathways of Covid-19 are still unclear. So just avoid them all. 
    * Large numbers of coronaviruses can be in the shit (besides many other pathogens). This even when the respiratory infection is over. Wash hands well with a lot of soap and ventilate the toilet. 
    * Many pathogens are transmitted through fomites. Pathogens can cause tissue damage and/or weaken the immune system. E.g. common cold viruses attempt to weaken the immune system [[kikkert](#kikkert)] and therefore can induce an increased infection risk.    

    But do NOT rely on hygiene alone, since there is strong evidence, that the majority of [transmissions occur through air](./transmission.md).

- #### Transport
  * Cars: Considering, that many people, especially children, will and should go outside right where they live, limited use of cars in cities is polite - it's nicer and safer with light traffic.
  * Public transport: Masks, distance if possible and ventilation


### Observe 
Observe the body, write down the observations and if possible measure.
The more common Covid-19 in a region is, the more likely it is, that an observed infection is Covid-19 and not flu/common cold. In my case - South East Switzerland, a day hike away from Northern-Italy - Covid-19 is/was (as of March 2020) the most prevalent disease. 

* Sars-CoV-2 can infect most locations in the respiratory tract except the vocal folds and the trachea. So all respiratory symptoms except a hoarse voice can indicate a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
* The precaution measures against Covid-19 protect against all respiratory diseases, so all respiratory diseases are reduced. Common colds are not common right now. So respiratory symptoms means being careful and even can mean figuring out all the people one could have infected and informing them to watch for symptoms.
* Every morning first smell and then taste your favorite breakfast drink.  
* Measure the temperature several times every day and best in the same situations and record the values. An increased temperature can be an early sign of a possible Sars-CoV-2 infection. However many people have only a slight increase, which doesn't "meet the definition of fever", see [Covid-19 symptoms](#symptoms). 
Keep in mind that the temperature varies during a day and with the activities performed. That's why several measurements. 

    > It's time [for medicine] to move on from digitalization and black-white schemes to the continuous color-space of Bayesian statistics. There's no hard border for fever at 37.5 or at 38 degrees.

### Estimate and Adaptive Planning
While we often prefer straight plans, adaptive planning is more suitable here. Like a game plan where one starts with a plan but needs to adapt depending on the moves of the adversary players. Viruses behave like adversary players and unpredictability/randomness is involved. One reason is that virions don't move on their own and so their movement is mostly random. Nevertheless probabilities can be estimated. E.g. a few days before visiting the grand grand parents, going out late every evening in densely populated pubs is not the best idea. However even if all precautions are taken, there is some probability that one falls sick, in that case it is important to withdraw from social gatherings.

Increased infection probability:
* **Increased Exposure to Viruses**:being in a densely populated and poorly ventilated indoor spaces or close range face to face talking
* **Increased Susceptibility to Viruses**: diminished immune system and increased inhalation of air (e.g. sports, high altitude)

Keeping benefits and risks in mind:
* whether, when and what to do and care about
* whether to take additional carefulness otherwhere. E.g. in the Tour the France not a single cyclist has caught Covid-19 [to check] despite excessive sports diminishes the immune system. This likely because they were able to reduce exposure to viruses by being careful and overall a good organization.

### Respect and Take Care 
> *We all should be able to live the life we want, as long that's respecting the rest of the world doing so too.* That needs compromises. Every day compromises are searched, negotiated, found and enabled - thanks to everybody! We live in groups with complex interactions, so *we* stands for groups of friends, families, communities, societies, countries and even us all. 

[*in rework: overall cases should be lower in cold season, since self protection is more difficult due to aerosol transmission (high filtration mask are possibly needed but these are (still) only limited available).*]
Respecting others having a different view of Covid yields an intermediate approach: base protections enabling people to avoid it, but not narrowing others much. 

* Precautions/Protection measures in place in public spaces which everybody needs to use. 
* In *non* general public settings respecting everybody to take/resume/go on with the lifestyle preferred - a considerate lifestyle of course. Depending on the epidemiological situation protections measures can be community/local decisions. E.g. universities provide both on campus and off campus studying.

> Many tasks and challenges are solved best or can only be solved by groups. Even small groups often need some organization, guiding and rules to work. For large groups such as societies these points are even more important. The better group members understand each other, understand the task and work together, the more liberal the settings and relaxed the rules can be.

Controlling SARS-CoV-2 is an individual, a local and global task. The better everybody helps to control it, the lesser the negative effects and the fewer rules and restrictions need to be put into place. 

* Staying out of crowds and taking care even with mild respiratory disease symptoms, a runny nose is enough reason to stay home. E.g. home office/school (e.g. reading)
  > much of the knowledge for this page I acquired by reading. Thanks to everybody making knowledge and articles available!
* Giving infections time to cure. It is known for various virus infections that they can become persistent.
* Respecting everybody who wants or needs (either directly since in risk group or indirectly since direct/indirect contact to persons who need/want to protect) to protect to do so. Long-term effects seem to be rare but experiences are still limited. Keeping cases low is good for everybody and the more people help doing so the better.
* Some slowdown of life: E.g. no party weeks, going home at time. For all including the young, a good immune system in place is crucial, which detects infections early, induces symptoms and clears them. 


### Live Healthily
A good immune system goes hand in hand with a healthy lifestyle:
* Sleep enough, eat healthily, relax and do some sport. 

and avoid anything that weakens the immune system:
* avoid excessive caffeine, excessive sport (if in a very high risk region), excessive alcohol ...
* avoid being cold or even freezing for a longer period. For this reason, in cold climates, windows shouldn't be open permanently. 
* avoid immunosuppressants unless necessary for medical reasons. 
* try reducing stress for yourself and others. Trying too hard won't help though. 
    
Stress is an important factor, who hasn't experienced falling sick after a stressful period? It's about balancing the different kinds of risks and chances we have been and are facing through our entire evolution.

### Overview
While there are possible explanations for many epidemiological observations of the Sars-2 strains, causing Covid-19, spread in the first months of 2020: spread mainly in absolutely dry and cold air and less spread in warm and humid air. Thus increased spread with increasing latitudes and away from coastal areas. Because cold and dry air likely increases both the [airborne transmission](#dry-form-model) and decreases the [mucus clearance](#decreased-mucus-clearance). Air pollution (-> [decreased mucus clearance](#decreased-mucus-clearance)) and increased public transport (-> increased spread) could contribute to the preference for cities of Sars-CoV-2. However some regional patterns fall through these reasons:
* in Switzerland not only the highest prevalence in severe cases (mild and moderate cases were not admitted to testing and thus not recorded in February/March/April 2020) but also the highest death rates are observed in Geneva (GE) and Ticino (TI), areas which have few cattle farming. On the other hand areas, where cattle farming is widespread across the entire area, seem to have an increased resistance: only a couple of deaths and few cases are recorded in the cantons LU, AI, AR, OW, UW, AG, TG. 
* Spain: In communities where cattle farming is common (Galicia, Basque Country and La Rioja)[to be confirmed], the death rate is lower and the recovery rate higher than in Central Spain. 
* Across the world no Covid-19 hotspot with many severe cases has been observed in regions with a lot of cattle farming. Teheran, Wuhan, Madrid, Milano and New York are not known as cattle farming regions. 

A possible explanation is that in cattle farming areas bovine coronavirus (BCoV)  are transmitted to humans such that the immune system is trained to fight Betacoronaviruses. Transmissions and the induced build up of some form of resistance could occur regularly or just once as an infant and possibly yield lifelong increased protection. Such an immune protection could explain why some people notice no or only few symptoms. Noteworthy some seniors remain mostly asymptomatic and other seniors experience severe or even fatal Covid-19.

The hypothesis above is possible in theory by the following exemplary observations (described in more detail in [biological basis](#biological-basis)).

Coronavirus infections in humans can elicit immune protection (more precisely no additional serum conversion is observed) to other coronaviruses  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012):   
   - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional)
   - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
    
A bovine coronavirus strain, namely HECV-4408,  was isolated from a child from a rural area in Texas suffering diarrhea [Zhang et al](#zhang94).

If a cross protection between BCoVs and Sars-CoV-2 exists and if yes how it works remains to be determined. Depending on the mechanism of action it could be used in many ways.


### Relevance 
The relevance depends on the [mechanisms of crossprotection](#mechanisms-of-crossprotection) and how much protection is provided. 
Possible use cases are polyvalent:

#### Epidemiological
- knowing that people have an increased immune protections and therefore experience only mild symptoms and possibly have reduced spreading of Sars-CoV-2 is relevant to manage the current Covid-19 pandemic. 
- Serum conversion occurrences: It could be that a different or no seroconversion occurs to people previously exposed to different strains of Betacoronaviruses.  

#### Medications
Knowledge of cross immune reactions can help to develop medications and even literal vaccines are thinkable vice versa. 
- increase the immune response against Sars-CoV-2 or even provide paths for full immunization
- even a literal vaccine is thinkable (the long-term pathogenesis of BCoVs needs to be reevaluated first)
- Sars-CoV-2 infections could protect against OC43 or other BCoV infections, which could be more harmful in the long run than Sars-CoV-2


### Evidence from Distribution of Covid-19 
In the following the in country distribution of Covid-19 is described. Since inside countries the testing schemes tend to be more or less uniform ([data specifications](#data-specifications)). Namely the data Switzerland and Spain are used , two countries in which only severe Covid-19 cases have been recorded. <!-- [todo: data wikipedia][in work] -->

#### Covid-19 in Switzerland
> The following analysis is for the months March and April 2020. In this period only severe Covid-19 cases were tested. Mild and moderate cases were not admitted to testing and thus not recorded in February/March/April 2020.

Incidence rates of both cases and deaths varies a lot between the different regions (Cantons which correspond to states).  
* In areas where cattle farming is prevalent  (AG, LU, AI, SG, FR, NE, ZH, VS, BE, FR, JU etc.), the number of deaths per 100K is about 6 in median and 8 in average (March and April 2020).

> Remark: Cattle farming is very common in many areas in Switzerland due to a long tradition and an accompanying tradition of making a variety of tasty cheeses. Care has been taken to preserve traditional recipes and the microbes used, throughout the industrialization of agriculture in the 20th century. Additionally the market for milk and meat is protected and significantly subsidized. The support is higher than for other forms of agriculture.

> Subjective Remark: I consider distributed agriculture as important and worth preserving. Both subsidies and protected markets are suitable means to support desired industries whether worth preserving or giving space to develop.
Economy solely on global effectiveness trimmed, yields that. But often only that. Question is, in which situations this is wanted. 

* In areas where cattle farming is less common the average number of deaths per 100K is about is about 30 in average and 32 in median [more accurate statistics on todo].
    Cantons with few cattle farming:
    - GE is a city canton and surrounded by Lac Lemon and France (less subventions there), 
    - BS is a city canton which has a long urban and trade tradition. In the south there are some forested hills, and in the west France and North-East is Germany
    - TI, has a few cattle farming but mostly close to the mountains and away from the cities. The largest city Lugano is surrounded by the Lago di Lugano and forests 
    - VD has cattle farming but most of the population lives around the Lac Lemon, where the largest city Lausanne is located. Lausanne  has mainly vineyards and forests to the North and Lac Lemon in the South.  
    
The same patterns are observed when considering only cantons with large cities or when considering only uniform language regions. Areas with a lot of cattle farming have lower death rates (both positive tested cases and per capita):
* Urbanized Areas: ZH, ZG have a lower rates GE, BS
* French Speaking Region: JU, FR, NE and VS have  lower rates both per severe cases and per population than GE and VD. 
* German Speaking Region: TG, AI, SG, LU, AG have lower rates than BS.


#### Covid-19 in Spain
The cattle rich regions in the North and North East: Galicia, La Rioja, Basque Country have a lower death rate and higher recover rate than Madrid, Valencia, Castile, Catalonia and Leon. As expected from the humid climate in the communities Canary Islands, Melila and Balearic Islands the recover rates are high and the death rates are low compared to central Spain. 

#### Remark
Similar patterns seem to be in the USA and France. For analysis, ideally the partitioning of population is fine-grained, at most a few 100K people per partition. 

#### Observed Interspecies Jumps
There are many examples where BCoVs jumped species borders, for which at least [interspecies infection](./coronavirus.md#infecting-new-species) is necessary but likely many occur until one yields a species jump. Frequent enteric coronavirus infections to humans occur(ed) likely, but they are not easy to prove [citation coming].
Examples where they have PCR confirmed:
* The HECV-4408 coronavirus was isolated from a child having diarrhea in 1994 as described in [Zhang et al](#zhang94)
Examples of a successful jump from BCoV between humans and bovine:
* OC43 likely was a BCoV jump to humans.


### Mechanisms of Crossprotection
[in rework]
[local T cells](./immune_system.md#local-t-cell) distributed through the respiratory tract recognize viral infections and induce cell death to prevent viral replication [argumentation 22.10. on todo-list]. 
* possibly by recognizing preserved parts of the initially translated ORFs
* but more likely local T cells recognizing more general anomalies of virus infected cells [in work]


#### Previous Guesses of Mechanisms likely False
* ##### Antibodies
    Antibodies against some well preserved parts of proteins. 
    - some extern proteins, which are preserved. The antibodies could either render the viruses uninfectious or acting as opsonin. Candidates:
        * S1
    - non extern proteins presented via MHC 1. The antibodies act as opsonin or are directly receptors of cytotoxic cells.
        * N
    First observations of cross immune protections are described. Then examples of host species jumps of betacoronaviruses are described including jumps from BCoV to humans.

    ###### Cross Immune Protections between different Coronaviruses
    [Cross immune protections](#cross-immune-protection) against coronaviruses have been observed for different strains, therefore cross protections can exists for coronaviruses.
    Examples of observed cross immune protections are:
    * [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012) observed by analyzing serum conversions (no additional serum conversion occurs):
        - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional)
        - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
        
    * [Han et al](#han) showed that calves inoculated with HECV-4408get cross-protective immunity against the strain BCoV DB2. HECV-4408 is a strain that has been observed to cause acute diarrhoea in humans, see [human bcov infections](#human-bcov-infections)
* ###### Local T cells and Antibodies
  Combination of tissue resident T cells and antibodies marking infected cells.   
* ###### Adaption of Macrophages
  Epigenetic adaption of alveolar macrophages [netea](#netea), [xing](#xing)
     
     
### Next Steps
* Analyse spread patterns in other countries: USA, France, ...
* Widespread serology for HCoVs and statistics if there's a relation to pathogenesis of Covid-19. 
* Analyse birth and grow up locations of elderly Covid-19 patients.
* figuring out whether BCoVs genetically cross/combine with other HCoVs. This could yield new strains with altered and possibly more severe pathogenesis.

## Early On Prevent Mucus Accumulations 

### Sections
* [Overview](#early-vents-overview)

* [Ideas to Decrease Virus Distribution](#decrease-distribution)
* [Appendix for Early On Ventilators](#appendix-vents)

<p id='early-vents-overview'>---</p>

### Overview
For the development of a virus-induced ARDS, a decreased mucus clearance seems to be a key factor; shown in the case of influenza induced ARDS by [Yuen et al](#yuen). The idea is to increase the clearance by increasing the mucus flow. The following observations suggest that the mucus flow is increased by humidified air:
- [Hong and colleagues](#hong) found that the mucus flow increases when using humidified air for ventilation. 
- [Hasani et al.](#hasani) found the same by humidifying the air in the entire room. 

That humid air increases the mucus flow, can be used as described or in other settings e.g. a stand-alone heated humidifier. 

Moreover, breath-support-devices can modify the distribution and spread of viruses in the lungs because of altered movement of the lungs and thus altered movement of air. The altered spread should be considered. 

#### Cascade of Influences
Increase humidity of inhaled air --> Increases the mucus clearance --> Decrease the viral load in the lower respiratory tract --> Increase the well-being and the overall prognosis
 
#### Causes for severe Outcome of Covid-19
[in rework, 22.10.]
A main complication of a severe Covid-19 and possible death cause is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) see e.g. findings from [Song and colleagues](#song). 

#### Mucus Hypothesis 
The reason for developing ADRS both for Covid-19 and influenza seems to be a delayed mucus clearance of viruses. This yields a high number of viruses distributed across the entire lungs.


<p id='reverse-cascade'>---</p>

### Reverse Cascade - Backtracking ARDS to a Decreased Mucus Flow
In the following evidence is shown in reverse order for the [cascade of influences](#cascade-of-influences).  The cascade reversed:
* ARDS is caused by widespread virus distribution [how: work in progress]
* widespread virus distribution is caused by a decreased mucociliary clearance and increased distribution from locations of infected cells-
* decreased mucus clearance is caused by dry air, hypertension, diabetes

#### evidence for widespread virus distribution
- In most severe cases (especially, where ADRS is observed and mechanical ventilation is needed) the images show _bilateral_ lung lesions/patches [Bhatraju et al.](#bhatraju),[Zhong et al.](#zhong).
- [Yuen et al](#yuen) found high late viral load for patients with an ARDS . 

#### causes of widespread virus distribution
For the widespread viral load distribution in the lower respiratory tract, possible reasons are:

- [increased replication](#increased-replication)
- [increased distribution across the lungs](#increased-distribution) 
- [decreased mucus clearance](#decreased-mucus-clearance)

##### Increased Replication?
likely NO, since:
[in rework]
There isn't much evidence for an higher replication rate of Sars-CoV-2 in ARDS risk group compared to hospitalized cases which don't develop ARDS. For people with only mild symptoms (especially children) early immune responses possibly limit the viral replication [in work]. There is limited data available comparing the viral load kinetics of people with mild symptoms [in rework: new studies suggest similar viral loads (May 2020)]. In the following the focus is on hospitalized cases. 

- data suggest no strong correlation between a diminished immune system and severe Covid-19 (see e.g. [zhong](#zhong))
- patients with ADRS seem not to have especially low antibody levels as results obtained by [To, Tsang et al.](#to_tsang) indicate. 
- data by [To, Tsang et al.](#to_tsang),[Yuen et al.](#yuen) suggest that an early high viral load is no clear indication for developing an ARDS.
- in young people the cell machinery tends to be more performant. So in theory viruses could spread more quickly. However their immune systeme is also more quick to react.

<!--todo: immune reaction -->

##### Increased Distribution?
likely NO, since:<br>
The Sars-CoV-2 entry ACE2 is expressed in large quantities in alveolar type 2 cells. From these locations, many particles are exhaled upon deep breathing [[Larsson](#larsson)], which could yield increased spreading both inside and outside. Thus to some extent the virus distribution depends on breathing patterns and so active people would be more at risk. Overall evidence is not strong that the widespread virus spread is solely caused by increased distribution.  

##### Decreased Mucus Clearance?
likely YES, since:
* observed for influenza by [Yuen et al](#yuen)
* Factors known to decrease the mucus clearance are major risk factors for developing ARDS, both for influenza and Covid-19. For more detail on factors see [appendix](#appendix-vents):
    * intern factors
        - age
        - obesity
        - diabetes
        - hypertension
        - smoking history
        - air pollution history (likely a risk factor for ARDS since most deaths are in larger cities. A decreased clearance has been shown for a variety of pollutants.)
    * extern factors
         - dry air 
             * humidified air increases mucus transport [Hong](#hong), [Hasani](#hasani)
             * generally fare fewer deaths and a lower death-rate in humid air countries, see [death rates](#humidity-related-death-rates). Rough estimate 0.2 % in humide air countries. Dry air countries are more difficult to estimate since treatment likely is much more relevant, see [methods](#increase-the-mucus-flow). 
             * For greyhounds under anesthesia, breathing air at 37 °C, a decrease in the tracheal mucus flow was observed if the relative humidity was decreased below 50% [[Forbes](#forbes)].
* Virus RNA early on in the alimentary seems not to be an indication for ARDS even though this indicates a high overall viral load:
    * there's indication that patients with early detection of viruses in stool, do not have worse outcome [case-series-france](#case-series-france)
    *  diarrhea is not risk for ADRS in influenza [Yuen](#yuen). 
    * increased nausea or vomiting seem to be no indication for a severe disease outcome [Zhong](#zhong)(despite these indicating higher a viral load in the stomach, so viruses are just better cleared to the alimentary). However vomiting a slight indication for ADRS in influenza [Yuen](#yuen).


<p id='decrease-distribution'>---</p>

### Ideas to Decrease Virus Distribution

#### New Methods ideally are  
- thought through by a variety specialists from different fields
- simulated if possible
- tightly supervised, observed and recorded test
- published, including raw data

__Note__:
These are unchecked proposals and should be carefully supervised. Ideally methods are __first simulated__, e.g. by methods described in the section [Particle Dynamics in Respiratory Tract](#particles). Anything that alters the natural airflow and thus possibly the distribution of viruses could cause irritations and infections in new locations. Methods likely doing this (e.g. High Flow Therapy) will not be further discussed here. <!-- todo add ref-->
 
#### Increase the Mucus Flow
Increase the mucus flow and clearance by increasing the humidity [Hong](#hong), [Hasani](#hasani)
This prevents the accumulation of viral loaded and dry mucus early on. This in turn should both increase the well-being as well as the overall prognosis. 

__Caution__: If there are already a lot of (dry) mucus accumulations, liquefying them could yield a likely __temporary but possibly dangerous__ increased distribution of virus parts and therefore an additional inflammation/irritation. While immune suppresive are generally discouraged, because they could yield a diminished immune reaction and possibly yield prolonged virus spread, in this situation they can be appropriate. 

* heated humidifiers in combination with a ventilator as described by [Hong et al. in 2014](#hong) i.e. in the way in which many pneumonia patients around the world receive successful treatment. 
    __Benefit__: This increases both the [humidity](#hong) and also decreases the spread of particles from the alveoli as observed by  [Lindstedt and colleagues](#lindstedt). __Risk__: general risks of invasive ventilation, temporary irritation due to liquefying of mucus. 

* a heated humidifier stand-alone i.e. as above but with no ventilator. __Benefit__: Increase humidity and thus mucus flow and easy to use with an oxygen mask. __Risk__: temporary irritation due to liquefying of mucus.
 
* Increasing the humidity in the entire room, increases the mucus flow too, as shown by [Hasani and colleagues](#hasani). __Benefit__: Simple use and a slight increase in mucus flow.  __Risk__: Some irritation due to liquefying can be possible. "Well tested" in tropical clima zones around the world.  

* Steam inhalation in the traditional way with a pot of hot water and a towel can help too. 
Careful handling: 
    - The steam inhaled should not be very hot, so some distance to the hot water is required. 
    - Start carefully and see how the body reacts
    - Start early on. Good for mild Covid. If in severe condition the steam may further irritate the mucous membranes and doctors should give treatment schemes.
    - Careful handling of the hot pot: A solid stand/table is recommended.

    __Benefit__: Simple use and a temporary increase in mucus flow. __Risk__:  If handled carefully the risks should be little. Irritation due to liquefying the mucus or because to hot steam is inhaled is possible.
    
#### Reduce the Spread of Viruses    
reduce spread -> reduce opening and closing of alveoli i.e. deep breathing [[Larsson](#larsson)][to be confirmed and checked how relevant this is for pathogenesis][particle based simulation may be possible]
- patients should breath as calm as possible
- slightly increased pressure may reduce opening and closing of alveoli [to be confirmed]
- ventilators possibly reduce the spread of particles ([Vents and Particle Spread](#mechanical-ventilators-and-particles-spread))

#### Mechanical Ventilators and Particles Spread
"Mechanically ventilated patients exhibit decreased particle flow in exhaled breath as compared to normal breathing patients" by [Lindstedt and colleagues](#lindstedt).  
To be investigated: 
* it could mean that they shed less viruses and less viruses are distributed throughout the lungs. *Likely*: since only part of the air is exhaled and most stays in the lungs and there are many brochni and alveolis the air can go back
* it could mean that more viruses stay in the lungs since there is less clearance. *Unlikely*:  since the major clearance occurs through mucus.

### Appendix for Early On Ventilators
Just indications are listened and no statistical testing has been done. Some times correlations have been determined in the papers given as sources. Ideally the statistics takes into account correlations between the various factors too; e.g. there is likely a correlation between age and chronic heart disease]. [todo: math, check dependence between observables][todo: add average for entire populations as comparison]


#### Factors Associated to severe Covid-19:

* [Zhong et al.](#zhong) noted characteristics of hospital admitted Covid-19 patients which are grouped into mild, severe and fatal cases. 
The numbers in parenthesis are 
    * observation rates in % of (fatal cases, severe cases(including fatal), mild hospitalized)

    strong relation:
    - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10.4 vs 3.5 vs 0.6)
    - Diabetes (27 v 16 vs 5.7)
    - Hypertension (36 vs 23.7 vs 13.4)
    - Coronary heart disease (9 vs 6 vs 2)
    - (Cerebrovascular disease)

    weak relation:
    - cancer (1.5 vs 1.7 vs 0.8)
    - chronic renal disease (3 vs 2 vs 0.5)

    very weak/no relation:
    - immunodeficiency (0 vs 0 vs 0.2)


* [Bhatraju et al.](#bhatraju) noted characteristics of Covid-19 patients from the Seattle-area with ARDS.

    strong relation:
    - Diabetes 58%
    - high body mass index (33.2±7.2)
    - Age (64±18 (23–97))

    weak relation:
    - former/current smoker 22%
    - asthma 14%

* In Italy [Onder et al.](#onder) analysed a subsample of 355 patients with COVID-19 who died in Italy: 

    strong relation:
    * mean age was 79.5 years (SD, 8.1) 
    * 117 patients (30%) had ischaemic heart disease
    * 126 (35.5%) had diabetes
    * 72 (20.3%) had active cancer
    * 87 (24.5%) had atrial fibrillation

    some relation:
    * 24 (6.8%) had dementia
    * 34 (9.6%) had a history of stroke

* The Covid-19 fatality rates are higher in cities and especially in cities which are not known for very clean air. Many Covid-19 related deaths are recorded in: Madrid, Milano, Teheran, New York and Wuhan [citation to be added]. According to findings from [Wolff](#wolff) dirty air can reduce the mucus clearance in various ways. 


<p id='influenza'></p>
    
#### Factors Associated with ADRS in Influenza    
The following characteristics are observed by [Yuen et al.](#yuen):
- For patient developing a ARDS coughing was more common than for patients, who didn't develop an ARDS. Since coughing is an emergency measure of the body to clear respiratory tract this an indication of bad clearance. 
- The Nasopharyngeal Viral load was even a little higher in the group, who didn't develop an ARDS.
- The tracheal viral load was much higher in the ARDS groups (less clearance!)
- Diabetis, Age, Chronic hear disease positively correlate with ARDS development. 
    

#### Factors influencing the Mucus Flow

* [Nakagawa et al.](#nakagawa) found that "Ageing, Diabetes, and Hypertension Are Associated With Decreased Nasal Mucociliary Clearance". The mechanisms of mucus production in the nose are likely similar to those in the trachea and therefore similar associations are expected [to be confirmed]. 

* In the review from [Houtmeyers et al.](#houtmeyers) "Regulation of mucociliary clearance in health and disease" has references to findings which indicate a decreased mucus flow and ciliary activity with age. 

* Dry Air especially below 50% relative humidity decreases the mucus flow in the trachea. Observed by [Forbes](#forbes)  for greyhounds under barbiturate anaesthesia breathing air at 37 °C.

* [Leopold et al.](#leopold-mahony-lian) observed smoking-associated shorter airway epithelial cilia which, according to their argumentation, yields a decreased mucus flow (described in the section "Implications of Reduction of Cilia Length on Mucociliary Clearance"). 

* In his review on ["Effects of Airborne Pollutants on Mucociliary Clearance"](#wolff)  Ronald K. Wolff summarizes "A variety of pollutants have been shown to impair mucociliary clearance following acute or subchronic exposures." 


#### Humidity related Death Rates

* Around the world fewer deaths per capita in humid air countries indicating a lower death-rate. There is a lower death-rate in Singapore/Kuwait/Qatar/Isreal than in Island/Norway, countries which all have a good health care system and do widespread testing ([data specifications](#data-specifications)). 
    - __Remark__: Norway and Isreal probably get half of the cases tested positive, so the death rate should be divided by 2. 
    - __Remark__: Mucus clearance may not be the only reason for lower death rates in humid air, but also that [Dry Form Infection](#abstract) and aerosol infection is less likely and therefore Covid-19 starts more in the upper respiratory tract than in the bronchi or alveolis [disease pattern](#infection-tropism-and-disease-patterns). 

* In a analysis ["Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China"](#luo) Luo et al. find a correlation in a time series analysis between a decreased humidity and and increased death rates (which likely corresponds to lowering the ARDS risk). The argumentation given here provides a possible explanation for their findings. The analysis depends however, on how accurate and consistent the analysed data are. In nearly all heavy hit regions around the world, the priority was and is and should be to save lives and not to count accurately. Remark: To recent news, the deaths published in Wuhan were those  in hospitals and not the total number of deaths. In this case the data is consistent and the treatment schemes tend to be more uniform for people in hospitals, so to analyse to impact of humidity this data is suited for analysis [data specifications](./monitor_and_control.md#data-specifications).

* Sometimes reviews or remarks in introductions are referred which point further to the original work/articles. 
* The references are named by the correspondence author, the primary authors or a descriptive tag. Studies carried out in 2020 are often named: first author followed by the correspondence authors. [todo more consistent naming]

> The correspondence author often are the head of the group/professors and tend to do research for a long time in the same area and topic. They often are responsible for the design and setup of the research. For these reasons the naming is done by the correspondence authors.

* Describing that the cell entry point is ACE2:
[1] (SARS-Cov-1), [2] (SARS-Cov-1), [9] (SARS-Cov-2)

* Describing the ACE2 \[surface\] expression locations:
[6], [12]

* Describing that some coronaviruses enter via the apical surface:
[3](HCov 229E, uses a different receptor however cell entry side is likely more conserved)
* Describing the viral distribution across the organs:
[5] (SARS-Cov-1), [6] (SARS-Cov-1),[14]
* Describing clinal findings which are most notable in the lung
* Describing that a relevant number of patients has only an increase in temperature below 38 degrees and so if fever is defined as a temperature above 38 no fever:
