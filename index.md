## Updates
### Recent Topics Added
- 13./14.6. [General Chapter on Vaccination](./10_vaccines/vaccines.md)
- 12./13.6. [Vaccine Safety Questions](10_vaccines/safety_questions.md): Open question and assessment of vaccines safety. It is argued that symptom watching is mostly not enough to ensure safety.
  > The chapter is rolling release since healthy and young people and even children are motivated or even pressured to get highly experimental (neither sufficiently disclosed, nor understood nor investigated) first generation 'mRNA' vaccines. Subtle but life-long adverse effects are possibly in theory.

  > In temperate climates on the Northern hemisphere, there is no need to rush vaccinating the healthy and young.
  
  > Risk groups in risk regions (e.g. countries in the Southern hemisphere) will thank for vaccines now. Later can be to late.

- 9.6. [Illustrative Resources](1_introduction/illustrative_resources.md): A subjective list of especially helpful, insightful and/or extraordinary Resources. Sometimes
- 12.5. [Aggregation of Atoms](9_physics/aggregations_of_atoms.md) page to provide context to topics such as condensation & evaporation and efflorescence.
- 23.3. [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment. It reduces the number of infectious virions and optimize the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
- 23.3. Proposal of [Local Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)


### Recent Updates
- 13.6. Split up Questions on Vaccines into [Safety Questions](./10_vaccines/safety_questions.md) and [Vaccination Effects on Infection](./10_vaccines/effects_on_covii.md)
- 10.6. Added in [notes on reading](#notes-on-reading) that referencing is always welcome.
- 8.6./9.6. Clarifications and reordering across the page.  On the [Controlling Page](7_social/controlling.md) added a section [Balancing of Measures](7_social/controlling.md#balancing-of-measures) and the previous Balance section renamed to [On Balancing of Measures](7_social/controlling.md#on-balancing-of-measures).
- 28.5.- 3.6. 
  - Formulations and clarifications across the page. 
  - Chapter [Life on Earth](2_biological/life-forms.md) in rework.
- 25.5. [Spread Analysis for Africa](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#africa) in online work.

## Notes on Reading
* Many parts are __hypothesis__ and __ideas__ but __not__ [double] checked facts. They are put here as ideas to be checked and evaluated. The chapters with not well founded content are tagged with *(explorative)*.
* The writing often is conversational and some parts aren't rigorous. 
* This is work in progress. Parts under heavy work are mostly marked with '[in work]'. Mistakes of any form are likely.
* _License_ The license is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. Relaxation: For any use with the main purpose of public health and public information no attribution is required (as long as its not copy & paste) but __referencing is always welcome__ (most content is founded enough by now). <!-- in science citing/Referencing is a good and helpful practice.-->
* _Support_ [Support on ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/H2H72F6XY) is welcome, to enable full-time re-searching on coronaviruses.
* Questions, pointing out mistakes, improvement suggestions and feedback are __welcome__.
* _[Table of Content](#content)_ The content is ordered mostly by dependencies i.e. content founding other sections is ahead. The dependencies are often circular however.
* _Source_ This page is open source on GitHub: [https://github.com/forestgrape/coronavirus/blob/master/index.md](https://github.com/forestgrape/coronavirus/blob/master/index.md), where it can be read both as Markdown and GitHub Preview and hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://forestgrape.github.io/coronavirus](https://forestgrape.github.io/coronavirus)
* _References_
  * Often references are summarized. Word-by-word extracts are in "_ _ _". The summaries are biased towards to results relevant for this page. To capture the essence of the research is tried too.
  * As much as possible original work is referred. Sometimes reviews or remarks in introductions are referred which point further to the original work/articles.
  * The references are named by the first author. (In the beginning of this work sometimes references were named by the correspondence author or a descriptive tag. Some sections still have this naming scheme).
  * References are usually grouped by topic. If several topics apply, one is chosen.
  * For term definitions and general topics, wikipedia (English), encyclopedia britannica and the oxford dictionary are frequently consulted. Currently they are referenced for each specific term. It is planned to improve this.
* _Formulations_
   Some are subjective and marked as [comments](#comments). Sometimes words are not weighted carefully or formulations are unclear/ambiguous. Upon discovery, unfitting formulations are improved. Feedback is appreciated and questions welcome.
> * _No Ambiguity:_ Some formulations especially in comments are general but ambiguity is not indented. The reason is clarity. (In the beginning, a few comments were ambiguous but this is not intended anymore, since this neither works nor fits a project like this.)
* _Symbols_
   * '=' denotes 'equals' or 'has the meaning of' or 'set equal to'
   * '=>' = implies
   * '->' = points to further content/explanations
   * 'a := b' = a defines b (to emphasize a definition or specify the order)
   * '&' := and  <!--('&' has a higher precedence than 'and')-->
   * {hello} = Repetition of hello e.g. hello, hello, hello
   * [to check] = Annotation if something is in work or needs checking. 
   * [good] morning = facultative word (same syntax as work annotations, distinction upon context)


> ##### Definitions
> *Definitions* are written like this and are valid throughout this page; sometimes only throughout this page. 

>> ##### New Definition
>> *'New' definitions* are written like this. 'New' means it is defined on this page and not a definition commonly used in literature (introduced on 15.5.21). 

> Redefinition of an existing terms is not done on purpose, unless explicitly noted. Please point out!

> ##### Comments
> * _Comments_, often subjective, are formatted the same as [definitions](#definitions) and sometimes additionally marked with programming style '//'. Otherwise distinction is done by context/content.
> * _Off Topic Remarks:_ Sometimes subjective off topic remarks are added. One reason for subjective off-topic remarks is transparency and background for the mindset behind suggestions.


> ##### Mindset in short
> * *We all should be able to live the life we want, as long that's respecting the rest of the world doing so too.*
> * Fairness is important. Attitudes or group memberships - as long as they respect others - should *only* matter if directly relevant and really necessary for the task of interest.
>
> More on the mindset in the chapters:
> * [Respect and Take Care](./1_introduction/suggestions.md#respect-and-take-care) on the Suggestion and Tips page
> * [Clarification on Comments](./1_introduction/update_history.md#clarifications-on-comments) on the Update History page
> * [Baseline Principles](./7_social/economics.md#baseline-principles) on the Economic page.

## Content

> Sometimes out of date, newest sections are announced in [recent updates](#recent-updates)].


### Introductory Topics
* [Recent Updates](#recent-updates) and [Update History](1_introduction/update_history.md)
* [Public Suggestions and Tips](1_introduction/suggestions.md)
    Keep distance and hygiene. Then outdoors is safe. Inside ventilate well and/or wear a mask. Transmission can be smoke-like. Don't burden the immune system.


### Biological Topics
- [Life Forms](2_biological/life-forms.md). Principles and concepts of life on earth.
  - [Mobility of Life Forms](2_biological/mobility.md) How life form move or get moved to cross distances.
- [Viruses](2_biological/viruses.md). What viruses are and what they can do and do. Viruses are defined as life forms which are dependent on extern enzymes. Aspects such as life cycle and behavior are discussed.
- [Virion Viability](2_biological/virion_viability.md)
  * Virions decay fast in sunlight, soap and disinfectants (the halflife time is a few minutes).
  * From 0 to 40 degrees the decay is faster at increased temperature and depends on the biochemical environment. In saliva, nasal mucus and sputum the halflife time is about 8 hours at 4 degrees and about 2 hours at a room-temperature of 22 degrees.
  * Above 45 degrees the decay fastens and is less dependent on the biochemical environment since the spring-loaded proteins loose their energy.
  * A fast decay occurs when the concentration of salts is very low in the surrounding water. This is the case in distilled water and in situations with a lot of condensation. Possible mechanisms: osmotic pressure or increase of degrees of freedom of movement especially of the single stranded RNA/DNA.
- [Coronaviruses](2_biological/coronavirus.md). Life cycle, distinguishing features and capabilities of coronaviruses.
- [Backtracing Sars-CoV-1/2](./2_biological/hosts_of_nidovirales.md#backtracing-sars-cov-12) (*explorative*)
    The natural habitat of SARS-CoV-1/2 includes domestic animals and insects in the region Northern Yunnan. The life cycle of SARS-like is alternating in hosts and follows nutrient cycles. 


### Medical Topics
* [Covid-19](3_medical/covid19.md)
    The Covid-19 results from the interplay between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 can infect different locations throughout the respiratory tract and  the immune response experienced depends on the location. Therefore Covid-19 is a disease with many faces. 
* [Diagnosis and Viral Load](3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) How to diagnose Covid with a focus on methods detecting parts of viruses (virus RNA with PCR or virus proteins with antigen test) at different locations (e.g. in the nose, mouth, lungs).
- [Infection Locations and Disease Patterns](3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) (*explorative*)


### Immunological Topics
* [Immune System](4_immunological/immune_system.md)
  Selected topics of the immune protection with a focus protection versus coronaviruses are discussed. 
* [Immune Evasion](4_immunological/immune_evasion.md) How coronaviruses circumvent immune system obstacles.


### Epidemiological Topics 
* [Transmission of Sars-CoV-2 with Focus on a Proposed Dry Form Transmission](5_epidemiological/transmission.md)
    Sars-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted airborne and even a Dry Form aerosol infection is possible.
  - A summary of airborne transmission, 
  - Proposal of a new dry from transmission model,
  - describe how particles behave in the respiratory tract,
  - analyse spread pattern of Covid-19 which indicate aerosol transmission
  - and based on the discussed transmission pathways, protection measures are suggested: smoke protection and masks.
- [Spread Analyses](5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) Situations where Covid-19 spreading is observed or is *not* observed are described. High transmission of severe Covid is observed in situations where much air is exchanged between people. Much air is exchanged when spending a lot time indoors without ventilation, crowded confined settings, at high altitude and when deep breathing (e.g. sports, singing).
- [Evidence for Increased Immune Protection against Sars-CoV-2 from Exposure to BCoVs](5_epidemiological/covid_and_bovine_farming.md) (*explorative section*)


### Treatment and Prevention
- [Movement](6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md) How movement helps to get a better immune reaction upon a Covid infection and to recover faster and better.
- [Masks](6_prevention_and_treatment/masks.md). Mask both reduce the spread and prevent infections. Not only from SARS-2 but from all viruses which infect through the respiratory tract e.g. influenza.
- [Topical Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to prevent and cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses (and other respiratory viruses) live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)
  - [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment: It reduces the number of infectious virions and enhances the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
  - [Increase the mucus Flow by humidified air](./6_prevention_and_treatment/increasing_the_mucus_flow.md): Humidify inhaled air early on to increase the mucus flow and wash the virions out. The goal is a reduce viral load and better prognosis. (explorative)


### Social Topics
* [Thoughts about Controlling Sars-CoV-2](7_social/controlling.md)
    Thoughts how to tackle and control Covid-19. Different kind of measures are discussed from physical (mask, ventilation) to social measures such as an early closure of nightlife.


### Data Topics
* [Monitoring](8_data/monitoring.md)
    About testing, monitoring, gathering and publishing data.


### Physical Topics
* [Aggregation of Atoms](9_physics/aggregations_of_atoms.md). How atoms aggregate to form the different kinds of matter.
