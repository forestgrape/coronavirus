## Recent Updates

- 25.4. Page coronaviruses separated into the pages:
  - [Life Forms](2_biological/life-forms.md). Principles and concepts of life on earth.
  - [Viruses](2_biological/viruses.md). What viruses are and what they can do and do.
  - [Coronaviruses](2_biological/coronavirus.md). Life cycle, distinguishing features and capabilities of coronaviruses.
  - [Motion](./2_biological/motion.md) How life form move or get moved to cross distances.
- 25.4. Clarifications on Comments: For conciseness all subjective and off topic remarks are formatted as [comment](#comments). Exception in context of Covid symptoms I mentioned transparency is important, but I also meant overall transparency - marked as comment now. There was a section was titled 'orientation matters' - describing that the cell orientation is relevant for coronavirus infection - this was not marked as comment and accordingly there was no second meaning in this case as stated in [comment on comments](#comment-on-comments). 
  > Orientations in the sense of attitudes or group membership, - in my view - *only* matter if relevant for the topic of interest. Often they are not relevant.
- 1.4. - 25.4. Formulations across the pages. E.g. added note that allowing and promoting outdoor activities often not only reduces the burden of Covid measures but often also help reducing severe Covid cases since less time is spent indoors and the lifestyles are healthier. Specified [support for closed businesses](7_social/controlling.md#support-for-individuals-and-businesses). 
- 1.4. Propelling Spikes: How coronaviruses use their spike proteins as propellors to fly around. Anytime they can move in all directions since their spikes are around the spherical virions. (special note consisting only of this two sentences). 
- 29.3. Navigation bar with table of contents added. Layout adaptions to place the navbar.
- 24.3. Regrouping [content](#content) into (currently) 8 topics both as files on github and content on github pages.
- 23.3. [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment: It reduces the number of infectious virions and enhances the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
- 23.3. Proposal of [Local Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)
- 23.3. Clarified summary for [Virion Viability](2_biological/virion_viability.md). [A table with compiled data](./2_biological/virion_viability/viability_data.md) from viability experiments is online.

## Notes on Reading
* Many parts are __hypothesis__ and __ideas__ but __not__ [double] checked facts. They are put here as ideas to be checked and evaluated. 
* Chapters with new or not well founded content are tagged with *(explorative)*.
* This page often conversational and some parts aren't rigorous and just ideas in raw form. 
* The page is in work. Parts under heavy work are mostly marked with '[in work]'. Mistakes of any form are likely.
* The license is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. with the following relaxations: For any use with the main purpose of public health and public information no attribution is needed (as long as its not copy & paste). <!-- in science citing/Referencing is a good and helpful practice.-->
* [Support on ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/H2H72F6XY) is welcome, to enable full-time re-searching on coronaviruses.
* Questions, pointing out mistakes, improvement suggestions and feedback are __welcome__.

* New content is announced in [Updates](#recent-updates). 
* A [Table of Content](#content) is provided. The content is ordered mostly by dependencies i.e. content founding other sections is ahead. The dependencies are often circular however.
* This page is open source on GitHub: [https://github.com/forestgrape/coronavirus/blob/master/index.md](https://github.com/forestgrape/coronavirus/blob/master/index.md), where it can be read both as Markdown and GitHub Preview and hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://forestgrape.github.io/coronavirus](https://forestgrape.github.io/coronavirus)

* Often references are summarized. Word-by-word extracts are in " ". The summarized are biased towards to results relevant for this page, even though it is tried to capture the essence of the research.

*   > ###### Definitions
    > *Definitions* are written like this and are valid throughout this page; sometimes only throughout this page. Redefinition of existing terms is not done on purpose, unless explicitly noted. Please point out!

*   > ###### Comments
    > *Comments*, often subjective, are formatted the same as [definitions](#definitions) and sometimes additionally marked with programming style '//'. Otherwise distinction is done by context/content.

    > ###### Comment on Comments
    > Subjective or off topic remarks are formatted as comments, if not the formulations are about the topic alone.
    > A section on the coronavirus page - with the content that Coronaviruses enter and leave cell preferable from the cell side pointing outwards (apical side) - was titled 'Orientation matters' for quite a long time and in the same section I had written McCray & Co instead of McCray et al. Both formulations I choose because of a 'cool' sound. The section is and was not marked as subjective accordingly I didn't intend any ambiguity.
    > * The word orientation was used in the sense of positioning  (google-scholar shows quite a few results with orientation matters and most are about physics and also the oxford dictionary lists position as the first meaning).  However, I acknowledge, that orientation is used in different contexts and depending on the background, what one thinks when reading 'orientation' can vary - often orientation is used to denote attitudes or sexual orientation. 
    > * McCray & Co does *not* imply that the research is business like, it is outstanding and shows a basics principle of betacoronavirus, namely they mostly live on the surfaces and not within tissues.

    > In my opinion, orientations in the sense of attitudes should *only* matter if important for the topic of interest (e.g. sexual orientation can matter for dating or sport preferences for sport friends). 
    
    > For a virus infecting a cell the orientation is usually not relevant, however it is relevant for coronaviruses infecting cell in the respiratory tract.

## Content

> Sometimes out of date, newest sections are announced in [recent updates](#recent-updates)].

### Introduction
* [Recent Updates](#recent-updates) and [Update History](#update-history)
* [Public Suggestions and Tips](./1_introduction/suggestions_and_tips.md)
    Keep distance and hygiene. Then outdoors is safe. Inside ventilate well and/or wear a mask. Transmission can be smoke-like. Don't burden the immune system.

### Biological Topics
* [Coronaviruses with a Focus on Sars-CoV-2](./2_biological/coronavirus.md#top)
Various aspects of coronaviruses are described with a focus on understanding. 
    - The starting point are first principles: life forms on earth. 
    - Viruses are defined as life forms which are dependent on extern enzymes and aspects such as life cycle and movement options are sketched. 
    - We then look at coronaviruses with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.

- [Virion Viability](./2_biological/virion_viability.md)
    * Virions decay fast in sunlight, soap and disinfectants (the halflife time is a few minutes).
    * From 0 to 40 degrees the decay is faster at increased temperature and depends on the biochemical environment. In saliva, nasal mucus and sputum the halflife time is about 8 hours at 4 degrees and about 2 hours at a room-temperature of 22 degrees.
    * Above 45 degrees the decay fastens and is less dependent on the biochemical environment since the spring-loaded proteins loose their energy.
    * A fast decay seems to occur in the presence of osmotic pressure e.g. when the concentration of salts is very low in the surrounding water. This is the case in distilled water and in situations with a lot of condensation.

- [Backtracing Sars-CoV-1/2](./2_biological/hosts_of_nidovirales.md#backtracing-sars-cov-12) (*explorative*)
    The natural habitat of SARS-CoV-1/2 includes domestic animals and insects in the region Northern Yunnan. The life cycle of SARS-like is alternating in hosts and follows nutrient cycles. 

### Medical Topics
* [Covid-19](3_medical/covid19.md)
    The Covid-19 results from the interplay between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 can infect different locations throughout the respiratory tract and  the immune response experienced depends on the location. Therefore Covid-19 is a disease with many faces. 
* [Diagnosis and Viral Load](3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) How to diagnose Covid with a focus on methods detecting parts of viruses (virus RNA with PCR or virus proteins with antigen test) at different locations (e.g. in the nose, mouth, lungs).
- [Infection Locations and Disease Patterns](./3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) (*explorative*)

### Immunological Topics
* [Immune System](4_immunological/immune_system.md)
  Selected topics of the immune protection with a focus protection versus coronaviruses are discussed. 
* [Immune Evasion](4_immunological/immune_evasion.md) How coronaviruses circumvent immune system obstacles.

### Epidemiological Topics 
* [Transmission of Sars-CoV-2 with Focus on a Proposed Dry Form Transmission](./5_epidemiological/transmission.md)
    Sars-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted airborne and even a Dry Form aerosol infection is possible.
    - A summary of airborne transmission, 
    - Proposal of a new dry from transmission model,
    - describe how particles behave in the respiratory tract,
    - analyse spread pattern of Covid-19 which indicate aerosol transmission
    - and based on the discussions protection measures are suggested: smoke protection and masks.
- [Spread Analyses](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) Situations where Covid-19 spreading is observed or is *not* observed are described. High transmission of severe Covid is observed in situations where much air is exchanged between people. Much air is exchanged when spending a lot time indoors without ventilation, crowded confined settings, at high altitude and when deep breathing (e.g. sports, singing).
- [Evidence for Increased Immune Protection against Sars-CoV-2 from Exposure to BCoVs](#evidence-for-increased-immune-protection-against-sars-cov-2-from-exposure-to-bcovs) (*explorative section*)

### Treatment and Prevention
- [Movement](6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md) How movement helps to get a better immune reaction upon a Covid infection and to recover faster and better.
- [Topical Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to prevent and cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses (and other respiratory viruses) live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)
  - [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment: It reduces the number of infectious virions and enhances the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
  - [Increase the mucus Flow by humidified air](./6_prevention_and_treatment/increasing_the_mucus_flow.md): Humidify inhaled air early on to increase the mucus flow and wash the virions out. The goal is a reduce viral load and better prognosis. (explorative)

### Social Topics
* [Thoughts about Controlling Sars-CoV-2](7_social/controlling.md)
    Thoughts how to tackle and control Covid-19. Different kind of measures are discussed from physical (mask, ventilation) to social measures such as an early closure of nightlife.

### Data Topics
* [Monitoring](8_data/monitoring.md)
    About testing, monitoring, gathering and publishing data.

## Update History
Larger updates here, smaller updates are noted in the section [Minor Updates](#minor-updates) below.

> Not all links work since the page structure has changed.

- 22.3. [Spread Assumptions section](./7_social/controlling.md#spread-assumptions) on the [controlling page](./7_social/controlling.md) added. Formulations across the page.
- 18.3. [Virion Viability Page](./2_biological/virion_viability.md) in online work (finally!). 
    * Virions decay fast in sunlight, soap and disinfectants (the halflife time is a few minutes).
    * From 0 to 40 degrees the decay is faster at increased temperature and depends on the biochemical environment. In saliva, nasal mucus and sputum the halflife time is about 8 hours at 4 degrees and about 2 hours at a room-temperature of 22 degrees, especially at air humidities around 40%. In dry air or high but not very high humidity the decay is slower.
    * Above 45 degrees the decay fastens (doubling about every 2 degrees) due to the spring-loaded proteins (spikes and sometimes N) loosing their structure and thereby the stored energy.
- 17.2. [Masks](./6_prevention_and_treatment/masks.md) now on separate page (moved from controlling). Added section about [Personal Mask Preferences](./6_prevention_and_treatment/masks.md#personal-mask-preferences)
- 13.2. How Coronaviruses overcome Immune System obstacles moved to separate page [Immune Evasion](./4_immunological/immune_evasion.md).
- 11.2. Corrected mistakes (T Cell Training) on the [Immune System page](./4_immunological/immune_system.md) and added/completed section how SARS-2 overcomes antibodies.
- 2.2. How [Movement](./3_medical/covid19.md#movement) helps to produce a good immune response and helps recovering from Covid on the [Covid-19 page](./3_medical/covid19.md).
- 2.2. Many small updates and clarifications across the page. E.g. added the importance of ventilation of stairwells in [large buildings](./7_social/controlling.md#large-buildings) on the Controlling page.

> ### A word of Caution regarding Vaccines (28.1., updated 14.2.)
> What worries me most at the moment is the vaccination rushes and races. It is great and an extraordinary achievement to have vaccines and vaccination programs are well organized. It increases the safety and life quality for people at risk for severe Covid-19. 
> 
> Regarding vaccine recommendations the known and the unknown are important:
> * What has been shown for the approved vaccines is, that they efficiently prevent Covid-19 with typical symptoms combined with positive NPS PCR test and severe Covid-19 at tolerable reactogenicity (typical vaccine side effects). 
> * What is mostly unknown/not investigated/not published are adverse effects such as immune system disorders or long-term effects. Especially in view of vaccinating young people, timely investigations/estimates (long-term) and publishing is needed. Both effects are less a concern for inactivated virus vaccines or other protein based vaccines as long as the adjuvants are harmless (which is not always sure e.g. the safety profile of aluminum is surprisingly unclear despite being in use for 90 years.). For other technologies the effects depend on the exact specifications. RNA vaccines are in general __not__ comparable to protein only vaccines (mRNA vaccines do produce proteins but they thereby often [likely always, to check] mess around with the depths of eukaryotic life. This induces a strong immune response with antibodies, stronger than for proteins alone).
> * There are open questions how  SARS-CoV-2 infections are changed apart from reducing typical/severe Covid-19: The effects of vaccines on virus shedding, virus evolution (both point mutations and recombination) and changed pathogenesis are mostly unknown/not investigated/unpublished.
>  
> An unbiased discussion is missing since many risks ignored and unknown risks are dismissed as not possible. 
> In my opinion, for the time being, the vaccines should be used as the evaluations published show clear benefits: For seronegative and PCR negative people at risk for severe Covid. If it turns out, that the benefits outweigh the risks, summer would be a good time to vaccine many/those not at risk. 
> [Argumentation in advanced work.]


- 22.12.-23.1. [Diagnosis and Viral Load](./3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) (before 18.1. on the Covid19 page). 
  - Repeated morning saliva and sputum have a reliable viral load which predicts the disease progression. 
  - Nose swabs have a detection rate of about 60% and the viral load does not predict disease progression.
  -  Experiences from HongKong (Summary [Wong](./3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md#summary-wong)) and an investigation from Dubai [Summary Senok](./3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md#summary-senok).
  
- 17.1. Respelled Salvia to Saliva. 
- 22.12. [Covid-19](./3_medical/covid19.md) redone. New sections about Diagnosis and Viral Load in online work - saliva has a similar sensitivity as nose samples. moved see 17.1.21
- 30.11. [Corona Conform Skiing](./7_social/controlling.md#corona-conform-skiing) on the page [Controlling](./7_social/controlling.md)
    > Motivated by current discussions and recent personal experience. 
- 24.11. New Page on [Economics](./economics.md): The proposal is to provide universal capital services (e.g. credits) instead of providing targeted support in different situations/crisis (e.g. the current Covid situation). Goals are:
  - Everyone in need can redesign and reorganize their (economic) life in any situation.
  - Making the economic system more fair in the sense that everyone has the opportunity to choose the economic way of life.
- 9.11. Formulations corrected and improved.
  > I spend more time on reading and analyzing than on formulations and proof reading. Although I try, sometimes words are not weighted carefully and it can take a couple of days to discover & improve unworldly formulations.
- 7.11. Updates in [Spread Analyses](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) in work:
  - [Infector Distribution](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#infector-distribution): 20% of infected were responsible for 80% of the transmissions detected by the contact tracing in Hong Kong.
  - Section on [Pre-symptomatic Infectors](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md#pre-symptomatic-infectors) in work
- 6.11. Renamed ~~"Monitor Failure"~~ to [Estimates Out of Bounds](./monitor_and_control.md#detect-estimates-out-of-bounds). Case numbers are case numbers and not estimates.
    > Mainly I was shocked by the very steep increase of deaths and still am [analyses in work]. Even though I spent/d a lot of time learning to analyse.
- 5./6.11. Updates in [Spread Analyses](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) in online work:
    * Evidence for super-spreader events at large scale sporting events with spectators. Evidence: 1) players are more frequently infected in regions with spectators and 2) there seem to be increased infection rates in the stadiums catchment areas.
      > Not proven yet but evidence strong enough that risk regions should **stop allowing large scale events** even with protection measures. As of 4./5.11. there still seem to be football matches with many thousand spectators.
    * Sections about observed spreading events in food production factories and airplanes.
- 1.11. [Strategy](./7_social/controlling.md#strategy) and [On Numbers](./8_data/monitoring.md#on-numbers) sections, where I give my point of view how to tackle Covid and for actions at different incidence levels.
- 31.10. [Detect Monitor Out of Bounds](./monitor_and_control.md#detect-monitor-out-of-bounds) in the extended section [Monitor Prevalence](./8_data/monitoring.md#monitor-prevalence) describes how to check estimates in the past: The current death rate multiplied by 400 (inverse fatality) should be about the case estimated a few weeks ago.
- 28.10. (only summaries available) Early results from [Spread Analyses](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) show that the Covid-19 transmission probability increases with the amount of air exchanged between people. Air exchange is high when indoors (either heated or air-conditioned) and at increased breathing (high altitude, sport, singing). This strongly indicates that [aerosol](./5_epidemiological/transmission.md#overview-airborne-transmission) transmission plays a key role. Thus good ventilation, less populated and good and clean mask help indoors and being outdoors with some distance is safe.
    > During the summer droplet transmission seemed most important, because of Covid-19 waves in regions where the sun was high combined with some research indicating that aerosol transmission is rare in humid and warm settings. Steep increase in Europa as climate cooled in October 2020 combined with extensive droplet preventions in place questioned the dominance of droplet transmission. Reconsideration and a detailed look show: The Covid waves, when the sun is high, occurred/occur either in hot areas and are well explained by air-conditioning or by high altitude:
    * Air-conditioning: Brazil, Middle East and Southern US (in California noteworthy is the difference between hot Los Angeles and temperate San Francisco)
    * High altitudes which means cold nights and increased breathing: La Paz in Bolivia, Quito in Ecuador and Bogota in Columbia or at high altitude combined with heat: Mexico City and currently (28.10.) in Kenya.
- 25.10. New page [Spread Analyses](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) in work: Observations and analysis how Covid-19 spreads in different settings.
-  > 24.10. Part of the early-online-updates below (16.10.) is a note about [corona conform schooling](./7_social/controlling.md#corona-conform-schooling) which needed correction: Pupils are **not** likely to play a major role in the past and current Covid spread while protection measures are in place.
-  15./16.10. Early Online Update for the sections [Protection Measures](./7_social/controlling.md#thoughts-about-social-measures) and [Transmission](./5_epidemiological/transmission.md) in online work. Due to steep increase of cases in Europe and new pieces of evidence regarding transmission.
    > The steep increases despite protection measures in place is noteworthy, since it indicates many hidden/undetected cases.
- 5.10./6.10. moved from literal single-page (all content in index.md) to multiple pages. Pages including short description are in the in the [content](#content). 
  > Even though I liked the single page version since it acknowledges the connections, multi-page is simpler to read & manage and helps to make the topics as self-contained as possible.
- 21.9. new section [Backtracing Sars-CoV-1/2](./2_biological/hosts_of_nidovirales.md#backtracing-sars-cov-12)
- 30.7. Updates and corrections across the page in work/in the process of writing down:
	* I wrongly ignored upper respiratory infections for a long time (because most hospitalized/severe cases were/are in the lungs) -> [Disease patterns](./3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md)
	* In the first months Sars-CoV-2 didn't have the ability to spread well in humid climate. This has changed: the currently circulating strains spread well in humid climate too.  
- 27.7. [Disease pattering](./3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md)
- 29.4/3.5. Reordering of content and new Sections 'Coronaviruses with a Focus on Sars-CoV-2' and 'Immune Protection with a Focus on Coronaviruses' 
- 17.4.20 00:04 GMT  New section online: Evidence for Increased Immune Protection against Sars-CoV-2 from Exposure to BCoVs
- 9.4.20 Extended section [Prevent Early On Mucus Accumulations](./6_prevention_and_treatment/increasing_the_mucus_flow.md), previously named Early On Ventilators 
- 4.4.20 Added Section Ideas to Explore
    - starting with [Early On Ventilators](./6_prevention_and_treatment/increasing_the_mucus_flow.md): Increase the mucus flow and clearance by humidified air early on,  to decrease the risk for developing ARDS. 
- 25-30.3/9.4.20:  Corrected and looked up aerosol/particulate inhalation which yields to the new section [Particles in the Respiratory Tract](./5_epidemiological/transmission.md##particle-dynamics-in-the-respiratory-tract).
    In the first version, I had written that aerosols don't enter the lungs. False. Aerosols DO enter the lungs. The train of thought yielding this mistake: Entering the lungs is halfway entering the body. So there must have been enough evolutionary pressure to prevent this. This is ~~double~~ triple wrong:
    1. The evolutionary roots of the lungs are the alimentary system (some dozens millions of generations ago), so substances coming in were just cleared down. Even as the lungs and the alimentary separated this process stayed. As we often do too, evolution usually gradually bends things right, rather than rebuilding from scratch.  
    2. The lungs developed before we were upright (just a couple of hundred thousand generations ago) and in the original case the clearance of aerosols is earlier and better; shown for mice in [Kleinstreuer](./5_epidemiological/transmission.md#kleinstreuer-2018). Ciliate based movement works even uphill, as ski tourers know. But there are limits. A gradual adaption evolved first, the oscillation frequency of the cilia increased, but wasn't yet enough so a workaround evolved:  smallest particulates are cleared by macrophages [citation to be added].
    3. Upright clearance evolved when we all were in warm and mostly humid parts of Africa (well it likely got a little drier in the winter months and savanna replaced rainforest in East Africa, so we had motivation to stand up more and more). In such humid environments, clearance works better. In evolutionary dimensions, there has been only a short time for the adaption to cold and dry climate (how much depends on the overall drive for adaption, which isn't straight forward to say since migration routes have twists, crossings and turns, desert nights tend to be cold around the world and lifestyles were and are different). To a permanent stay in heated indoor spaces, there has been and no genetic adaption at all.
