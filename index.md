* This is work in progress, so mistakes of any form are likely. 
* The page started with a proposal for a Dry Form Transmission Model and that the Covid-19 transmission can be metaphored smoke-like.  More [content](#t-content) has been added since and noteworthy changes are mentioned in [updates](#updates). 
* These are __hypothesis__ and __research ideas__ but __not__ double checked facts. They are put here as ideas to be checked and evaluated.

## Updates and Added Content
- 3.5. Reordering of content and new Sections 'Coronaviruses with a Focus on Sars-CoV-2' and 'Immune Protection with a Focus on Coronaviruses' added to github pages/master branch (since 29.4. published as github branch coronasection)
- 17.4.20 00:04 GMT  New section online: Evidence for Increased Immune Protection against Sars-CoV-2 from Exposure to BCoVs
- 9.4.20 Extended section [Prevent Early On Mucus Accumulations](#early-vents), previously named Early On Ventilators 
- 4.4.20 Added Section Ideas to Explore
    - starting with [Early On Ventilators](#early-vents): Increase the mucus flow and clearance by humidified air early on,  to decrease the risk for developing ARDS. 
- 25-30.3/9.4.20:  Corrected and looked up aerosol/particulate inhalation which yields to the new section [Particles in the Respiratory Tract](#particles).<br>
    In the first version, I had written that aerosols don't enter the lungs. False. Aerosols DO enter the lungs. The train of thought yielding this mistake: Entering the lungs is halfway entering the body. So there must have been enough evolutionary pressure to prevent this. This is ~~double~~ tripple wrong:
    1. The evolutionary roots of the lungs are the alimentary system (some dozens millions of generations ago), so substances coming in were just cleared down. Even as lungs and the alimentary separated this process stayed. As we often do too, evolution usually gradually bends things right, rather than rebuilding from scratch.  
    2. The lungs developed before we were upright (just a couple of hundred thousand generations ago) and in the original case the clearance of aerosols is earlier and better; shown for mice in [Kleinstreuer](#kleinstreuer). The ciliate based movement works even uphill, as ski tourers know. But there are limits. A gradual adaption evolved first: increase the frequency of the cilia, but wasn't yet enough so a workaround evolved:  smallest particulates are cleared by macrophages [citation to be added].  
    3. Upright clearance evolved when we all were in warm and mostly humid parts of Africa (well it likely got a little drier in the winter months and savanna replaced rainforest in East Africa, so we had motivation to stand up more and more). In such humid environments, clearance works better. In evolutionary dimensions, there has been only a short time for the adaption to cold and dry climate (how much depends on the overall drive for adaption, which isn't straight forward to say since migration routes have twists, crossings and turns, desert nights tend to be cold around the world and lifestyles were and are different). Finally to a permanent stay in heated indoor spaces, there has been and no genetic adaption at all.    
    
#### Minor Updates 
- 30.4. Regrouped and extended topic on measures and data into a new section [Thoughts on Monitor and Controlling Sars-CoV-2](#monitor-and-control)
- 28.4. Short note to support public health in the data section
- 25.4. Data availability section

## Public Advice, Suggestions and Thoughts
Do not take Covid-19 lightly: it can be serious in the short-term and whether long-term effects can be caused is unknown - tough such effects are not more likely than for other (corona)viruses causing common colds. But no reason to be afraid, unlike viruses we've got a mind, better communication and a superb body police called immune system. The immune system is crucial since completely avoiding viruses is _not_ possible. Viruses can be harmful but mostly the immune system handles them and they even can support us evolving. 

Time to act mindfully and work together in an open and honest way. 

   
- The coronavirus transmission is best thought smoke-like. How smoke behaves we know, since we can smell it, unlike the viruses. Just smelling smoke is the theoretical possibility of infection.  Being that exposed to smoke that the cloth start smelling, likely corresponds to a probability of a few percentages to get infected. Keeping the smoke model in mind makes it easier to detect and avoid risky situations: A neighbors candle won't harm through doors, but in a place with an indoor barbecue, smoke travels to the next floor. For Covid-19 this means: A single neighbor being infected is no risk, but in place with possibly many infected people e.g. a hospital treating Covid-19 patients, wearing a mask in _all_ rooms is important.

- Wear a mask in indoor places where infectious people can be. The longer one stays, the more people there are and the less ventilation there is, the more important. This because the infection risk increases with the amount of indoor air breathed.
   Reuse the mask, but put it into 60 to 70-degree hot water for 30 minutes every day  or wash it with soap. [Chan et al.](#chan) have shown that this inactivates the coronavirus (Remark: shown for Sars-CoV-1).  From time to time it should changed or washed thoroughly - there's more than Sars-CoV-2, don't forget that!

- Distancing reduces infection risk.  If possible avoid crowded indoor spaces. 
    
- Ventilate the rooms regularly by opening all windows for 5 minutes.  If possibly infected, always ventilate before opening the door of your room or flat. [Ventilation](#ventilation) has been shown to be effective. 

- Outside is safe, if some distance is kept. Ideally, walk or cycle directly from home. Primarily Covid-19 is transmitted indoors. So beware the corridor and stairwell, don't stay too long or wear a mask. 

- Transport: 
    * Cars: Considering, that many people, especially children, will and should go outside right where they live, limited use of cars in cities is polite - it's nicer and safer with light traffic. 
    * Public transport:
         * Wear a mask and/or limit usage to reduce infection paths. 
         * Ventilation is key in public transport. If possible open the windows from time to time, this works well thanks to the outside airflow. Put ventilation on max, turn off in tunnels and never put on circulation. 
         * If there are old toilets, that go to the rails, do _not_ use to shit!

- Don't have dry air inside; drying the frequently washed cloths inside keeps the air humid. In dry air, both dust and viruses stay longer in the air. Dry air also reduces the defence of the respiratory tract against pathogens. 

- Keep proper hygiene. Especially wash the hands well with a lot of soap after toilet. Before eating wash them too. Soap destroys coronaviruses. Hygiene is important because:
    * transmission pathways of Covid-19 are still unclear. So just avoid them all. 
    * it is known that viruses causing common cold can be transmitted through droplets. Viruses often try to weaken the immune system [[kikkert](#kikkert)] and therefore can induce an increased infection risk. 
    * avoiding a common cold or flu is important, because Covid-19 symptoms can be somewhat similar. This could mean quarantine and figuring out all the people one could have infected and informing them to watch for symptoms.   

    But do NOT rely on hygiene alone, since there is strong evidence, that the majority of [transmissions occur through indoor air](#spread-patterns) and not with droplets or fomites. 
  
  
- Observe your body, write down the observations and if possible measure: Measure the temperature several times every day and best in the same situations and record the values. An increased temperature can be an early sign of a possible Sars-CoV-2 infection. However many people have only a slight increase, which doesn't "meet the definition of fever", see [Covid-19 symptoms](#symptoms). The temperature if measured on the forehead may go from a typical 35 to 36 degrees. Side note: It's time [for medicine] to move on from digitalisation and black-white schemes to the continuous colorspace of Bayesian statistics. Keep in mind that the temperature varies during a day and with the activities performed. That's why several measurements. <br>
    The more common Covid-19 in a region is, the more likely it is an observed infection is Covid-19 and not flu/common cold. In my case - South East Switzerland, a day hike away from Nothern-Italy - Covid-19 is/was the most prevalent disease. 

- Live a healthy lifestyle 
    * sleep enough, eat healthily, relax and do some sport 
    
    and avoid anything that weakens the immune system:

    * avoid excessive caffeine, excessive sport (if in a risk region), excessive alcohol ...
    * avoid being cold or even freezing for a longer period. For this reason, in cold climates don't open the windows permanently. 
    * try reducing stress for yourself and others. Trying too hard won't help though. 
    
  Stress is an important factor, who hasn't experienced falling sick after a stressful period? It's about balancing the different kinds of risks and chances we have been and are facing through our entire evolution.

# Covid-19

### public description
__Remark__: The description given below agrees with the expected pathogenesis of mild cases. However, to put it on a solid basis more cases would need to be considered since it is only based on a couple of first-hand descriptions of mild cases, including a posteriori diagnosis of myself: 
> Even though I wasn't asymptomatic, the diagnosis was not obvious at first. Partly due to lack of respiratory symptoms - not a single cough if I recall correctly - and the supposed low prior probability according to official prevalence and partly because I didn't want to have it and so was satisfied with not experiencing known and obvious symptoms. It first felt like a minor food poisoning but no vomiting or the like. Just felt strange for one to two days. A temperature increase was there too - up to 35.5 - 36.5 from my normal range at rest 34.5 - 35. But since I didn't record the temperature systematically before, the temperature measurements around 36 degrees were more calming instead of ringing the bells. Symptoms faded. Later, there was a strange sticky feeling in the chest starting a day after an intense sport session - at this point, I started seriously considering Covid. Counting everything up it likely was Covid-19 and the sports session likely gave the viruses the opportunity to spread within the lungs. Noteworthy too: before the first symptoms, I had a long day and a rather stressful sleep afterward, so the immune system likely not had enough time and resources to control the viruses. 


Covid-19 is different from a common respiratory disease. It doesn't start with a sore throat nor with a runny nose, it starts from within, from the lungs. Early symptoms can be some chill (because the body is increasing the temperature to fight the viruses) or some strange feeling, similar to a weak poisoning when having eaten something rotten or drunken too much. Feeling tired, energy-less and having an increased recovery time after sports are indications too. However these symptoms are not specific to Covid-19, they can have other causes: Cold air, having eaten something rotten or not having had enough sleep. These early symptoms can be easily overlooked, so the first thing to notice may very well be a sore throat or loss of smell/taste - these symptoms come when high numbers of viruses are breathed up and reach the mouth and the nose, at this time, one is already shedding many viruses. Coughing is typical too, the body wants to get rid of the viruses in the respiratory tract. Later symptoms can be a strange feeling in the chest like something sticky being inside (dry mucus loaded with viruses) or even shortness of breath (the lungs are inflamed). Diarrhea can both start early and later on and can outlast the respiratory infection by days or even weeks. If most of the symptoms are observed in the described order it is/was likely Covid-19.

### symptoms
[in work]
* Only a slightly increased temperature, often below 38 degrees, has been observed in many patients ([Zhang](#zhang), [Wong](#wong), [Zhong](#zhong)). The increase can be as low as one degree: going up from 35 to 36 if measured on the forehead.

# Thoughts on Monitor and Controlling Sars-CoV-2
This section extends and   [Public Advices and Suggestions](#public-advice) section. 
## Content
* [Protection Measures](#protection-measures)
* [Monitor](#monitor)
* [Data Availability](#data)

<p id='protection-measures'></p>

## Protection Measures
The following relies on the assumption that the main transmission of Sars-CoV-2 is airborne (either aerosol or dry form transmission), which is not yet confirmed, even though there is evidence as described in [Proposal of a Dry Form Transmission Model](#transmission-models). As described in the final section of the proposal [Metaphor and Measures](#metaphor-and-measures), dry form transmission can be thought smoke like and aerosol/droplet is similar to avoiding somebody's reek of alcohol.  For the first non-smokers protections are a guideline. For the latter distancing works well. 

### support the immune protection
Completely avoiding Sars-CoV-2 can be as hard as avoiding dust and smoke. This is hard. Even in laboratory settings [Wurtz, Raoult et al](#raoult), [Artika and Ma'roef](#artika), it is difficult to completely avoiding virus infections and  Sars-CoV-1/2 especially. There were cases of infection in labs with Sars-CoV-1 [Orellana et al](#orellana), [Lim et al](#lim) and recommendations for autopsies of Covid-19 fatalities are very strict [Finegan et al](#finegan). Outsides, once the virus is widespread, avoiding coming in touch with Sars-CoV-2 is nearly impossible. Therefore the most important protection available is a good immune system. Vaccines - once available - just can prepare the immune system and not replace it. So main focus should be to support the overall immune protection of humanity. This is especially true in tropical regions where Sars-CoV-2 spreads less. A good immune system is important for many more reasons.  
[in work]
Proposals to increase the immune system:
* providing settings that support good health
    - allow people out to the fresh air
    - enviromental protection and clean air
* lessen stress
    - affordable life including basic health care
    - less pressure in workplaces
* healthy nutrition 
* providing information and tips to focus on the immune system and health


### masks
In risk regions officially recommend masks, since they mitigate the infection risk. Without an official recommendation, people can be put off or look afraid of masks, at least in Europe, which is not desirable. The recommendation should be strong for people feeling sick or with coughs in indoor public rooms.
* [Milton et al.](#milton2013) measured the influenza viruses spread from patients with and without wearing a surgical mask. They found:
    - Surgical masks nearly eliminated viral RNA detection in the coarse aerosol fraction (greater than 5 micrometer) with a 25 fold reduction in the number of viral copies 
    -  statistically significant 2.8 fold reduction in copies detected in the fine aerosol fraction (smaller than 5 micrometer)
    - Surgical masks significantly reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold.
    

    Assuming for  reduction of small exhaled aerosols an average of 2.5 and a reduction 50%, so a factor 2, for inhaling: everybody wearing a mask would yield a reduction of factor 5 = (2 times fewer particles inhaled) * (2.5 times fewer particles in the air since fewer exhaled). This can yield a significant reduction in public indoor rooms (e.g. Supermarkets or Public Transport). <!--This would be a greater reduction in the reproduction factor than  observed for other measures. A factor 5 reduction would be enough to reduce the reproduction factor below 1 if an initial value of 4 is estimated (an estimate from the imperial college in London by Ferguson, Bhatt et al](#ferguson-bhatt).[in work]-->



<!--  
Reasons against masks seem sometimes rather searched:
* touching more often the face. Remark: Infection is not possible by touching the skin alone, this is true for the skin in the face too. Touching into the mouth or the nose is something else, but for this masks are protective. 
* Reserve for healthcare workers is needed for the big wave. Remark: If masks are shown to help prevent the big wave in its roots, then that's the better option.-->


### ventilation

* [Escombe et al](#escombe) show natural ventilation is a valid measure and that in the first few minutes of opening the windows a major part of air is exchanged ([escombe: Figure 1](#https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040068.g001)).
* [Salathe et al](#salathe) simulate both the airborne (aerosol) and droplet spread of influenza, based on observed contact patters of high school students. They find that good ventilation is in their setting as effective as vaccinating around half of the population. 

### distancing
Both aerosol/droplets (reek of alcohol like spread) and dry particulates (smoke-like) can be reduced with distancing. Outside or with good ventilation, less distance is required. So if inside 2 meters is good, outside likely half a meter is enough. Wind direction should be considered outside. Inside, the airflow can have a direction too: e.g. the kitchen hood and the toilet venting draw air. 

<p id='monitor'></p>

## Monitor 
### Step by Step Lessening of Measures
* Monitoring the personal of newly opened businesses can be an indication for a new/increased Sars-CoV-2 spread. Representative samples twice per week should do the job. 
* Workers and patients of old-age homes, hospitals and similar institutions should monitor their health closely, watch for early Covid-19 signs and have easy access to Covid-19 PCR tests. Test can also be used to do sampling and monitoring. Early action is important in these settings. 
* All people belonging to a risk group for severe Covid-19 should be eligible to obtain free masks from pharmacies and doctors. The health care professionals should evaluate the model for a good fit and instruct the usage. For self protection good fit is important. Surgical masks are not always optimal since they are constructed for comfort and inside-to-out protection and not outside-in protection. The health care workers can also determine if self cleaning is an option: wash with a lot of soap or use heat to around 70 degrees for 20 minutes e.g. hot water, steam or in the oven - all measures which have been scientifically proven to destroy the Sars-CoV-2 viruses and leave the mask intact [citation coming]. 


<p id="data"> ---</p>
    
## Data 

Data production/collection, data description and data analysis can be done separate today. Remark: Separation of roles has a long tradition in science: Tycho Brahe collected the planetary motions, Kepler described them and Newton explained them. 

Today separation of roles can be done faster, easier and in cooperation, thanks to modern communication technologies. The basis is, that data is observed/produced, recorded (often free today), annotated and searchable published.

<!--
* there are many skilled data scientists around the world. Many spending their time presenting us the most relevant ads. Relevant usually means highest click rate i.e. most distracting. Whether the distraction is good or bad depends on pre and post activity, e.g. to analyze Covid data for a change can be welcome. Remark: I consider adds as useful for product information and spread. -->

#### data specifications

For data analysis it is important to have accurate, consistent and clearly specified data and notifications if the data may not be accurate or the specifications changed. Notified corrections are helpful too.  
The different data measurement methods related to Covid-19, combined with no or few specifications, have a lot of space for improvement all around the world and a worldwide agreement on annotations and publishing of country/region specific specifications would make the data at least partially comparable. 

E.g. In Switzerland, the testing policy, which is mostly followed, is to test only people who are sick _and_ belong to a risk group as of 17.4.20. This is hard to find on the official page from the BAG (Swiss Health Department, bag.admin.ch in the German Covid-19 FAQ) and even left out on the English version (as of 17.4.20). On official statistics on the same domain, there is no note about this testing scheme. The data are analysable (since generally consistent) and expressive but just not comparable to countries, where everybody who is sick or even everybody who could be infected is tested.
Remark: As of 1.5.20 more people are allowed to test. 

> Subjective Remark: While not perfect, the government and the BAG in Switzerland do overall a good job. What I consider done right: A slow down of life to have people focus on the important things among those health. A temporary slow down of spread to buy some time for preparation, experience gain and research. Personally, I liked (and helped me doing this page) that there was no stay at home order. Allowing people and especially children to go outside is important. The longer Covid-19 spread patterns can be analyzed the more evidence is there is, that the virus spreads mainly in dry indoor environments. A gradual reopening starting in April makes sense. 
Room for improvement: Masks benefits indoors and that outdoors infection risk is fare smaller should be clearly stated. 
To rate afterthought is much easier than to be there in charge with few proven and sure knowledge. In that view, there was a difficult choice and no right or wrong. Most countries found their path according to their situation. But I think now it is time to ease lockdowns step by step, especially in areas where there are not many severe Covid-19 cases. However around the world it remains important to support public health and keeping some slow down can be part of that. 
Right or Wrong and Perfection anyways are often a matter of viewpoint and angle. 

#### data features
* For analysis is useful to have as finegrained data as possible i.e. age, medical conditions and locations as accurate as data protections law permits. 
* Clinical observations well annotated and as complete as possible. Interpretation and analysis are nice to have but not necessary. 

#### easy readable
Data ideally are in a common format (e.g. CSV) on a public API (e.g. GitHub repository/REST API), are annotated and contain a readme with the specifications what and how is measured.

# Coronaviruses with a Focus on Sars-CoV-2

## Introduction to Viruses

> <span id='virus'> A _virus_ is a form of life that can't produce all of its needed  enzymes. While outside of a cell and ready to infect a cell a virus is called _virion_.</span>

Once a virus hijacks/infects cells, it usually changes the cell's metabolism to produce rough copies of itself. So viruses are dependent on the host cells. Therefore longterm surviving virus strains often have a symbiotic relationship with their natural host life form as a whole but they can be fatal for individuals. The survival of fit ecosystem is ubiquitous in nature. 


> <span id='infected-cell'> A cell is called _infected_ by a virus if it contains genetic material of the virus which influences the cell's metabolism. These can mean that the virus is replicating inside the cell. But a cell is also called infected if only some viral genes are translated. </span>

> <span id='infectable-cell'> A _infectable cell_ is a cell which can be infected. There are [constraints on a cell](#cell-constraints) to be infectable </span>

> <span id='infected-entity'> A entity is called _infected_ by a virus if it contains cells that are infected. Entity can be a tissue, an organ or an organism.</span> 

> <span id='infectable-entity'> A _infectable entity_ is an entity which can become [infected](#infected-entity). Entity can be a tissue, an organ or an organism.  There are constraints on a [entity to be infectable](#target-constraints).</span>

><span id='infectable-organism'> An *Infectable organism* is just a a special case of an [infectable entity](#infectable-entity) where the entity is an organism. This means cells in the animal are [infected](#infected-cell) by the virus. </span>



<p id="intro-to-coronaviruses">-----</p>

## Introduction to Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses belong to Nidoviruses which share a pattern of replication within a cell. 
Nidoviruses are positive single-stranded, non-segmented and enveloped RNA viruses. This means that their genetic material is encoded as a single positive strand of RNA - the same way as messenger RNA pieces of the cell. Enveloped means they have a membrane. The membrane consists of a lipid bilayer and proteins and forms a sphere. Among the membrane proteins are large spike proteins. Theses spike protein point out of the sphere, which gives coronaviruses a crown (in latin corona) like appearance under the electron microscope.

### proteins 
- cleavage other proteins and RNA [to check] 
- structural proteins: used to give newly built viruses structure. These are the membrane proteins and the internal protein N stabilizes the RNA
- diminish host defence

<p id='life-cycle'>-----</p>

## Life Cycle 
[in work]

### reach an infectable cell
A virion needs to be matched with a target cell up to some dozens of nanometers. The match can be the active or passive i.e. the virion reaches the host or the host reaches the virion. 
These can involve the following steps (steps in [<step>] are facultative):
- [an exploitable host]  
- [an exploitable tissue]
- an exploitable cell

### cell entry
- the virus gets attached to the matching receptor on the target cell mostly via the spike protein
- fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes
- release of genetic material and proteins into the cell
- start metabolism 

### metabolism
[in work]
- RNA-translate the genome with frame-shifting-> single protein -cleave-> pieces of proteins -assemble-> polymerase protein (protein capable of transcription of RNA to RNA)
- start transcription yield new mRNAs, which in turn are translated to proteins

### replication
The metabolism can produce new virions that are released from the cell.

### next targets
* the same cell type| another cell type
* the same tissue| another tissue 
* the same host| another host 


<p id='movement-of-virions'></p>

## Intermezzo Movement of Virions 
Once virions are released from a cell the virions are moved by whatever movements there are and/or be moved due to Brownian motion:

* __Carrier Organism__: This is mostly the host where the virus was built but it can be an animal just carrying the virion i.e. a vector. 
    - movements of body fluids. Examples are
        * the blood flow if the virion is in the bloodstream
        * the mucus flow 
        * the air breathed in and out and the [particle dynamics in the respiratory tract](#particles) associated.
    - solid movements within the host i.e. the virion is on a moveable body part. This can be
        * the movement of a hand 
        * the movement of the lungs to breath 
    - movement of the host itself and thereby transport the virions. The farther, faster and the more possible host at new location the better for the virus to distribute. The optimal transportation used to be fare flying animals: birds, bats. The inventions of the airplane and the following jetting around the world from city to city made us humans new optimal hosts.
* __Carrier Material__:
    These can be any material e.g. a piece of tissue a virion is attached to. These materials are in turn subject to another form of movement. 
* __Extern Movement but Not Carrier Organism__:
    - Wind
    - Water
* __Brownian Motion__: Brownian motion denotes the random movements of objects in a fluid. [to be extended] The Brownian of viruses is very small and by Brownian motion alone a virion can only reach close by cells.
    
<p id="life-cycle-constraints">-----</p>

## Life Cycle Constraints
Each step  in the life cycle has constraints. 

A virion needs to reach a host, the  location of the target cells (e.g. an organ), a specific cell and then it needs to reach a matching receptor on the cell membrane. All this without being able to move on its own, as described in [movement of virions](#movement-of-virions). Some bacteria can at least move the last two steps. Each step has a success rate of at most a few percents, so the combined probability of reaching a target is very low. 

### reach a host constraints
Often a virion needs to be outside of a host to reach a next exploitable host. In this case the probability to reach a new host is tiny, due to many obstacles for virions to reach another host:
* get attached to a wrong thing. The probability of this is extremely high due to the random movement. 
* sunlight destroys virions. 
* heat
* chemical environment

### host constraints
Reaching a host with infectable cells is not enough. The host immune system should be diminished or not know the virus. 
    
### reach a tissue constraints 
The outer layer of a body i.e. the surface of a body - anything that can be reached while the body is not injured - is called epithelial layer and the cells epithelial cells i.e. the cells on the surface. This layer has often various protections e.g. dead cells (which is the case for the skin) or mucus (which is the case in the respiratory tract). So even if a virion reaches a target host there still many obstacles to reach an exploitable tissue:
* acidic fluids (e.g. stomach acid)
* mucus clearance
* protecting layers: dead cells on the epithelium (e.g. skin)

### tissue constraints
The tissue needs to provide the right environment around the target cells.
* The spike proteins of coronaviruses needs to be cleaved for cell entry. This cleaving can require the right physiological conditions [Holmes](#holmes). 
* Also the cell environments shouldn't deactivate the virus, e.g. antibodies do so.
 
### cell constraints 

#### matching receptor
To enter a cell a virus needs his 'grappling hook' (usually the spike protein) to bind on a receptor on the cell membrane to get attached.  Next the virus needs to pass the cell membrane, this step is usually achieved by cleavage of the spike protein which then becomes a 'key' for fusion with the cell membrane. In the case of coronaviruses, the keys are often the spike-proteins. 

#### right environment inside the cell

<p id='evolution-and-adaption'>-----</p>

## Evolution and Adaption
The evolution rate of coronaviruses is fast because of a short average generation-time and the mechanism they copy their RNA. The mechanism of RNA copying [[Woo et al.](#woo)] [more refs coming] is: 
* RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which yields a high rate of random point mutations.  
* a homologous recombination mechanism. 
Coronaviruses have large genomes (in comparison to other viruses and messenger RNAs) which both back the mentioned recombinations and encodes complex proteins. Overall they can fast adapt to changed or new environments if given time and opportunity and they can change the metabolism of the target cells in various ways. 
[in work]

<p id='section-habitat'>-----</p>

## Habitat
As discussed in [life cycle constraints](#life-cycle-constraints) there are many conditions for a virus to replicate. Since evolution and adaption are the same for viruses, a virus strain is best adapted to a certain environments. These environments are habitats:
><span id='habitat'> A *Habitat* of a virus are collections of [cells](#infected-cell) or [entities](#infectable-entity) such as tissues, organs, organisms, or even collection of organism which are frequently infected. E.g. Sars-CoV-2 frequently infects alveolar type 2 epithelial cells. These are called a habitat as well as the surrounding organ: the human lungs. </span>

><span id='endemic'> A virus strain is *endemic* in a collection of organism if that collection is a habitat of the virus.</span>

><span id='host'>A *Host* of a virus is an [infectable organism](#infectable-organism) and these infections occur frequently i.e. are part of the life cycle.</span>

Sometimes it is helpful to differentiate hosts upon their role they play in the virus spread:
><span id='natural-host'>A *Natural Host* of a virus is a [host](#host) and the infections are relevant for the spread of the virus.</span>

><span id='side-host'>A *Side Host* of a virus is a [host](#host) and the infections are _not_ relevant for the spread of the virus. E.g. the virus cannot replicate effienctly or the virions cannot leave the host. These infections can be viewed as side-effects of the random virus spread. </span>


Possible habitats are subject to constraints by life cycle. For viruses in natural equilibrium, the locations are involved in the survival of the virus strain i.e. relevant for spread. 
Places relevant for spread can be:
* cells in which efficient virus replications takes place. 
* cells which upon infection diminish the host immune response. 

So in natural equilibrium hosts are usually natural hosts too. Hosts which are non Natural Hosts occur primarily if the environmental conditions improved for a virus. 

### interspecies transmissions
As the [movement of virions](#movement-of-virions) is random, virions reach things they get attached to at random. If a virus strain frequently reaches animals of some species, there are several cases [for programmers: switch(animal) aka animal match]:
* the animal reached is a host -> continue life cycle 
* the animal reached is not a host:
    - it is NEVER infectable -> break
    - it is infectable. This yields an [*interspecies infection*](#interspecies-infection). Again two cases:
        * the virus can not regularly leave the host i.e. it is a cul-de-sac -> break
        * virions frequently can leave to infect other hosts -> gives rise to a new life cycle: an [*interspecies jump*](#interspecies-jump) has happend. Since likely the evolutionary drive changes this gives raise to a new virus strain. 
        
    

> <span id='interspecies-infection'> An _interspecies infection_ is when an animal which is not a [natural host](#natural-host) animal becomes infected by a virus strain. </span>

> <span id='interspecies-jump'> An *interspecies jump* denotes a transmission to a new species and the species becomes a new [natural host](#natural-host) i.e. the new species becomes a habitat of the virus. The virus strain will likely evolve to an adapted new strain.</span>

So an interspecies infection denotes a transmission without spread in the new species. If these infections occur frequently the new species becomes a side host but not a natural host. Frequent infections allow the virus strain to adapt to the new host. The host may become part of a life cycle of a possibly new virus strain which is then an [interspecies jump]

### conquering new habitats
The virus can get attached to a cell type or host the given strain hasn't been endemic. Most likely the entity of viruses doensn't manage to adapt to the new target. However if a line of viruses manages to adapt to this new target, this becomes a new habitat. If the new target is a new species an interspecies transmission has occurred. Since in new habitats there often is a different evolutionary drive, the line of viruses can give rise to a new virus strain.  

#### observed interspecies infections
* all occurrences where [interspecies jumps](#interspecies-jumps) occurred at least one [interspecies infection](#interspecies-infection) must have occurred. But it is likely that many interspecies infections occurred before the jump happened. 
* Infections of Humans:
    There are quite a few reports on that BCoV regularly causes infections in the human intestines. Most of them are based on EM images and serological evidence. However, since most groups couldn't cultivate the viruses and there's some doubt [citations on the way]. 
    - The HECV-4408 coronavirus was isolated from a child having diarrhea [Zhang et al](#zhang94)


### observed interspecies jumps
* jumps: The bovine coronaviruses have likely jumped to a whole range of hosts: canine, human, pwild ruminants, porcine [Bidokhti et al](#bidokhti).
* jumps to humans: MERS, Sars-CoV-1, Sars-CoV-2, OC43 are all well known jumps to humans. 


<p id='habitat-of-sars-cov-2'>-----</p>

## Habitat of Sars-CoV-2
The task determine to habitat of Sars-CoV-2 in humans can be tackled either a [theoretical constraint based reasoning](#constraint-reasoning) or by an [empirical reasoning](#empirical-reasoning) based on observations of Covid-19.

### constraint reasoning
In the following the habitat of Sars-CoV-2 is deduced from the [life cycle](#life-cycle) and its [constraints](#life-cycle-constraints) of Sars-CoV-2. 
#### cell receptor
The cell entry receptor used by SARS-CoV-1 [[Jiang](#jiang)] and SARS-Cov-2 [[LiF](#lif)],[[Hoffmann](#hoffmann)] is ACE2 . 
The barrier function of the apical cell layer and in vitro cell experiments from [McCray & Co](#mccray05) show both increased apical ACE2 expression and an corresponding increased cell entry from the apical side. McCray & Co also observed that Sars-CoV-1 exits the cell on the apical side following an apical entry with a preference of more than 1000:1. (similar observations for another Coronavirinae, namely 229E,  which infects the cells, corresponding to the entry point amino-peptidase N expression, preferably from the apical surface [[McCray](#mccray)] and exits apically with a preference of 10:1 for apical entry and 5:1 for basal entry).    

#### tissue distribution of ACE2
There are two common methods to measure tissue distribution of proteins:
* _antibody staining_: to detect ACE2 an anti-ACE2 antibody. Detects proteins on cell surfaces, however they just can be attached to the cell without being built into the cell membrane. . Used in the work of [Timens](#timens), [McCray](#mccray05) 
* _detect mRNA_: e.g. ACE2 mRNA. Necessary condition for local protein expression, however not sufficient for ACE2 on apical cell surface, see e.g. [Li et al](#li)

For being an exploitable entry point, ACE2 should be built into the cell membrane as a receptor i.e. being useable from the outside. So if _both_ of above methods yield positive, this is very likely. 

ACE2 is apically expressed on lower respiratory tract epithelial cells, 
Especially well-differentiated and ciliated airway epithelia [[mcray05](#mccray05)] and in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells [to check/find citation]. In the upper respiratory tract, only the basal layer of the non-keratinised squamous epithelium of the nasal and oral mucosa and the nasopharynx expresses ACE2 [Timens](#timens), [Lau](#lau). 

### empirical reasoning
Viral load in combination with the [movements of virions](#movement-of-virions) inside the body give indications for tissue preferences of Sars-CoV-2. 
#### sars-cov-2 viral load
The viral load observed in different parts of the body are consistent with airborne infection and the tissue distribution of ACE2:
* The only location where _all_ patients had viral Sars-CoV-1 load are the lungs [Farcas et al](#farcas). 
* For MERS-Cov [Memish et al.](#memish) found that both the viral load and the Genome Fraction obtained was higher in the lower respiratory tract (broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, tracheal fluid) than in the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swab, sputum). The three broncho-alveolar lavage fluid samples investigated, showed the highest average viral load and contained the most complete genome. <br>
Remark: Mers-Cov has a different cell entry receptor (DPP4). However the ability of a virus to efficiently takeover a cell depends not on the cell entry receptor alone (extended explanation in work). This is just a piece of evidence in the overall picture. 

That in swab tests there are viruses in the nose and the mouth can be attributed to breathing them out. [Kleinstreuer et al](#kleinstreuer) have shown that upon exhale particles are deposited in the nose. An active infection in the upper respiratory tract would likely yield a viral load in the lymph nodes too [to be confirmed, citation needed].

# Immune Protection with a Focus on Coronaviruses


[in work]
Some topics and findings of the vertebrate immune protection relevant for other parts of [this site](#home) are described. 


## cross immune protection
Despite the overall high mutation rate of coronaviruses, the replication mechanism within a cell and proteins needed for this replication and some structural proteins are well conserved. Therefore there are similar patterns upon infection with different coronaviruses, which the immune system can recognize or can be targeted by medications.

### cross protections observed
*  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012) observed that some serum conversions against one coronaviruses are not followed by serum conversion against another coronavirus as follows:
    - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional, both OC43 and HKU1 are betacoronaviruses)
    - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
* [Han et al](#han) showed that calves innoculated with HECV-4408get cross-protective immunity against BCoV DB2. HECV-4408 is a strain that can cause acute diarrhea in humans, see [human bcov infections](#human-bcov-infections)

* [next steps](#next-steps)

### overview
While there are possible explanations for many epidemiological observations of the Covid-19 spread - especially latitude preferences - by the gradient of warm and humid to cold and dry indoor air. Because cold and dry air likely increases both the [airborne transmission](#model) and decreases the [mucus clearance](#decreased-mucus-clearance). Air pollution (-> [decreased mucus clearance](#decreased-mucus-clearance)) and increased public transport (-> increased spread) could contribute to the preference for cities of Sars-CoV-2. However some regional patterns fall through these reasons:
* in Switzerland not only the highest prevalence but also the highest death rates are observed in Geneva (GE) and Ticino (TI), areas which have few cattle farming. On the other hand areas, where cattle farming is widespread across the entire area, seem to have increased resistance: only a couple of deaths and few cases are recorded in the cantons LU, AI, AR, OW, UW, AG, TG. 
* Spain: In communities where cattle farming is common (Galicia, Basque Country and La Rioja)[to be confirmed], the death rate is lower and the recovery rate higher than in Central Spain. 
* Across the world no Covid-19 hotspot has been observed in regions with a lot of cattle farming. Teheran, Wuhan, Madrid, Mailand and New York are not known as cattle farming regions. 

A possible explanation is that in cattle farming areas bovine coronavirus (BCoV)  are transmitted to humans such that the immune system is trained to fight Betacoronaviruses. Transmissions and the induced build up of some form of resistance could occur regularly or just once as an infant and possibly yield lifelong increased protection. Such an immune protection could explain why some people notice no or only few symptoms. Notworthy seniors sometimes remain mostly asymptomatic or experience severe symptoms. 

The hypothesis above is possible in theory by the following exemplary observations (described in more detail in [biological basis](#biological-basis)).

Coronavirus infections in humans can elicit immune protection (more precisely no additional serum conversion is observed) to other coronaviruses  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012):   
   - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional)
   - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
    
A bovine coronavirus strain, namely HECV-4408,  was isolated from a child from a rural area in Texas suffering diarrhoea [Zhang et al](#zhang94).

If a cross protection between BCoVs and Sars-CoV-2 exists and if yes how it works remains to be determined. Depending on the mechanism of action it could be used in many ways.


### relevance 
The relevance and usage depends to a large extend on the [mechanisms of action](#mechanisms) and how much protection is provided. 
Possible use cases are polyvalent:

#### epidemiological
- knowing that people have an increased immune protections and therefore experience only mild symptoms and have reduced spreading of Sars-CoV-2 can be used to manage the current Covid-19 pandemic. 
- Serum conversion occurrence: It could be that a different or no seroconversion occurs to people exposed to different strains of betacoronaviruses.  

#### medications
Knowledge of cross immune reactions can help to develop medications and even literal vaccines are thinkable vice versa. 
- increase the immune response against Sars-CoV-2 or even provide paths for full immunisation
- even a literal vaccine is thinkable (the long-term pathogenesis of BCoVs should be reevaluated first)
- Sars-CoV-2 infection could protect against OC43 or other BCoV infections, which could be more harmful in the long run than Sars-CoV-2



### Evidence from Distribution of Covid-19 
In the following the in country distribution of Covid-19 is described. Since inside countries the testing schemes tend to be more or less uniform.[data wikipedia][in work]

#### covid-19 in switzerland
Incidence rates both of cases and deaths varies a lot between the different regions (Cantons which correspond to states).  
* In areas where cattle farming is prevalent  (AG, LU, AI, SG, FR, NE, ZH, VS, BE, FR, JU etc.), which is the case in many areas of Switzerland due to a protected market and subventions, the number of deaths per 100K is about 6 in median and 8 in average.  

> Remark: I consider distributed agriculture as important and worth preserving. Both subventions and protected markets are suitable means to support desired industries whether worth preserving or giving space to develop. In Switzerland agriculture support is especially strong for bovine farming and thus its high prevalence. <br>
Economy solely on global effectiveness trimmed, yields that but only that. Question is, in which situations this is wanted. 

* Contrary to areas where cattle are less common the average number of deaths per 100K is about is about 30 in average and 32 in median [more accurate statistics in work].
    Cantons with few cattle farming:
    - GE is a city canton and sourrounded by Lac Lemon and France so less subventions there, 
    - BS is a city canton which has a long urban and trade tradition. In the south there are some forested hills, and in the west France and north east is Germany
    - TI, has a few cattle farming but mostly close to the mountains and away from the cities. The largest city Lugano is surrounded by the Lago di Lugano and forests 
    - VD has cattle farming but most of the population lives around the Lac Lemon, where also the largest city Lausanne is. Lausanne is surrounded mainly by vineyards and forests in the North and Lac Lemon in the South.  
    
The same patterns are observed when considering only cantons with large cities or when considering only uniform language regions: Areas with a lot of cattle farming have lower death rates (both per positive tested cases and per capita):
* Urbanized Areas: ZH, ZG have a lower rates GE, BS
* French Speaking Region: JU, FR, NE and VS have  lower rates both per cases and per population than GE and VD.
* German Speaking Region: TG, AI, SG, LU, AG have lower rates than BS.


#### covid-19 in spain
As in Switzerland the same pattern is observed in Spain:
The cattle rich regions in the North and North East: Galicia, La Rioja, Basque Country have a lower death rate and higher recover rate than Madrid, Valencia, Castile, Catalonia and Leon. As expected from the humid climate in the communities Canary Islands, Melila and Balearic Islands the recover rates are high and the death rates are low compared to central Spain. 

#### Remark
Similar patterns seem to be in the USA and France. 

### Biological Basis
First observations of cross immune protections are described. Then species jumps of betacoronaviruses are described and even jumps from BCoV to humans have been observed. 
[in work]

#### observed cross immune protections between different coronaviruses
[Cross immune protections](#cross-immune-protection) against coronaviruses have been observed for different strains, therefore cross protections can exists for coronaviruses. 
Examples of observed cross immune protections are:
* As already noted in the introduction  [Van der Hoek et al.](#vanderhoek2012) observed by analysing serum conversions:
    - OC43 -protects-> HKU1 (only unidirectional)
    - NL63 -protects-> 229E (only unidirectional)
    
* [Han et al](#han) showed that calves inoculated with HECV-4408get cross-protective immunity against BCoV DB2. HECV-4408 is a strain that can cause acute diarrhoea in humans, see [human bcov infections](#human-bcov-infections)

#### Interspecies Transmission
 There are even many examples where BCoVs crossed species borders, for which a [interspecies infection](#interspecies-infection) is necessary. Frequent BCoV infections to humans occur likely but they are not easy to prove. 
Examples where they have proven or there is strong evidence are:
* The HECV-4408 coronavirus was isolated from a child suffering diarrhoea in 94 as described in [Zhang et al](#zhang94)
* OC43 likely was a BCoV jump to humans so frequent infections before are likely. 


### mechanisms
In the following mechanism of actions are guessed. 

* Epigenetic adaption of alveolar macrophages [netea](#netea), [xing](#xing)
* Antibodies against some well preserved proteins parts. 
    - some extern proteins, which are preserved. The antibodies could either render the viruses uninfectious or acting as opsonins. Candidates:
        * S1
    - non extern proteins presented via MHC 1. The antibodies act as opsonins or are directly receptors of cytotoxic cells.
        * N
     [in work]
     
     
### next steps
* Analyse spread patterns in other countries: USA, France, ...
* Widespread serology for HCoVs and do statistics if there's a relation to pathogenesis of Covid-19. 
* Analyse birth and grow up locations of elderly Covid-19 patients.
* figuring out whether BCoVs can genetically cross with HCoVs. This could yield new strains with possibly more severe pathogenesis.

## Early On Prevent Mucus Accumulations 

### Subsections
* Overview
* Reverse Cascade - From ARDS to Decreased Mucus Flow
* Ideas to Decrease Virus Distribution
* Appendix for Early On Ventilators

### Overview
For the development of a virus-induced ARDS, a decreased mucus clearance seems to be a key factor, shown by ([Yuen et al.](#yuen) for Influenza). [Hong and colleagues](#hong) found that the mucus flow increases when using humidified air for ventilation. [Hasani et al.](#hasani) found the same by humidifying the air in the entire room. This observation that humid air increases the mucus flow can be used as described these two settings or with other settings e.g. a stand-alone heated humidifier. Moreover, breath-support-devices may not only be used to humidify, additionally there are indications they may reduce the spread of viruses in the lungs. 

#### cascade of influences
Increase humidity of inhaled air --> Increases the mucus clearance --> Decrease the viral load in the lower respiratory tract --> Increase the well-being and the overall prognosis
 
#### Causes for severe Outcome of Covid-19
A main complication of a severe Covid-19 and possible death cause is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) see e.g. findings from [Song and colleagues](#song). 

#### mucus hypothesis 
The reason for developing ADRS both for Covid-19 and influenza seems to be a delayed mucus clearance of viruses. This yields a high number of viruses distributed across the entire lungs.

In the following evidence is shown for the reverse [cascade](#cascade-of-influences): 
* ARDS is caused by widespread virus distribution [how: work in progress]
* widespread virus distribution is caused by a decreased mucociliary clearance and increased distribution from locations of infected cells-
* decreased mucus clearance is caused by dry air, hypertension, diabetes

### Reverse Cascade of Evidence

- In most severe cases (especially, where ADRS is observed and mechanical ventilation is needed) the images show _bilateral_ lung lesions/patches [Bhatraju et al.](#bhatraju),[Zhong et al.](#zhong).
- [Yuen et al](#yuen) found high late viral load for patients with an ARDS . 

For the widespread viral load distribution in the lower respiratory tract, possible reasons are:

- [increased growth of viruses in the cells](#increased-growth)
- [increased distribution across the lungs](#increased-distribution) 
- [decreased mucus clearance](#decreased-mucus-clearance)


##### increased growth

Overall there isn't strong evidence for increased growth of viruses in ARDS risk group:

- data suggest no strong correlation between a diminished immune system and severe Covid-19 (see e.g. [zhong](#zhong))
- patients with ADRS seem not to have especially low antibody levels as results obtained by [To, Tsang et al.](#to_tsang) indicate. 
- data by [To, Tsang et al.](#to_tsang),[Yuen et al.](#yuen) suggest that an early high viral load is no clear indication for developing an ARDS.
- in young people the cell machinery tends to be more performant. So in theory viruses could spread more quickly. 

<!--todo: immune reaction -->

##### increased distribution
The Sars-CoV-2 entry ACE2 is expressed in large quantities in alveolar type 2 cells. From these locations, many particles are exhaled upon deep breathing [[Larsson](#larsson)], which could yield increased spreading both inside and outside. 

##### decreased mucus clearance 

* observed for influenza by [Yuen et al](#yuen)

* Factors known to decrease the mucus clearance are major risk factors for developing ARDS, both for influenza and Covid-19. For more detail on factors see [appendix](#appendix-vents):
    * intern factors
        - age
        - obesity
        - diabetes
        - hypertension
        - smoking history
        - air pollution history (likely a risk factor for ARDS since most deaths are in larger cities. A decreased clearance has been shown for a variety of pollutants.)
    * extern factors
         - dry air 
             * humidified air increases mucus transport [Hong](#hong), [Hasani](#hasani)
             * generally fare fewer deaths and a lower death-rate in humid air countries, see [death rates](#death-rates). Rough estimate 0.2 % in humide air countries. Dry air countries are more difficult to estimate since treatment likely is much more relevant, see [methods](#increase-the-mucus-flow). 
             * For greyhounds under anesthesia, breathing air at 37 °C, a decrease in the tracheal mucus flow was observed if the relative humidity was decreased below 50% [[Forbes](#forbes)].
* Virus RNA early on in the alimentary seems not to be an indication for ARDS even though this indicates a high overall viral load:
    * there's indication that patients with early detection of viruses in stool, do not have worse outcome [case-series-france](#case-series-france)
    *  diarrhea is not risk for ADRS in influenza [Yuen](#yuen). 
    * increased nausea or vomiting seem to be no indication for a severe disease outcome [Zhong](#zhong)(despite these indicating higher a viral load in the stomach, so viruses are just better cleared to the alimentary). However vomiting a slight indication for ADRS in influenza [Yuen](#yuen).


### Ideas to Decrease Virus Distribution [in work]

#### new methods ideally are  
- thought through by a variety specialists from different fields
- simulated
- tightly supervised, observed and recorded
- published, including raw data

__Note__:
These are unchecked proposals and should be carefully supervised. Anything that could alter/increase the natural airflow and thus possibly the distribution of viruses could cause irritations and infections in new locations. Ideally such methods are __first simulated__, e.g. by methods described in the section [Particle Dynamics in Respiratory Tract](#particles). Such methods (e.g. High Flow Therapy) will not be further discussed here.
 
#### increase the mucus flow
Increase the mucus flow and clearance by increasing the humidity [Hong](#hong), [Hasani](#hasani)
This prevents the accumulation of viral loaded and dry mucus early on. This in turn should both increase the well-being as well as the overall prognosis. 

__Caution__: If there are already a lot of (dry) mucus accumulations, liquefying them could yield a likely __temporary but possibly dangereous__ increased distribution of virus parts and therefore an additional irritation. While immune suppresive are generally discouraged, because they could yield a diminished immune reaction and possibly yield prolonged virus spread, in this situation they can be appropriate. 

* heated humidifiers in combination with a ventilator as described by [Hong et al. in 2014](#hong) i.e. in the way in which many pneumomia patients around the world receive successful treatment. 
    __Benefit__: This increases both the [humidity](#hong) and also decreases the spread of particles from the alveoli as observed by  [Lindstedt and colleagues](#lindstedt). __Risk__: general risks of invasive ventilation, temporary irritation due to liquefying of mucus. 

* a heated humidifier stand-alone (i.e.) with no ventilator. __Benefit__: Increase humidity and thus mucus flow and easy to use with an oxygen mask. __Risk__: temporary irritation due to liquefying of mucus.
 
* increasing the humidity in the entire room, increases the mucus flow too, as shown by [Hasani and colleagues](#hasani). __Benefit__: Simple use and a slight increase in mucus flow.  __Risk__: Some irritation due to liquefying can be possible. "Well tested" in tropical clima zones around the world.  

* Steam inhalation in the traditional way with a pot of hot water and a towel could help too. L. Use in early phase only since the steam may further irritate the mucous membranes. __Benefit__: Simple use and a temporary increase in mucus flow. __Risk__: Start with short times and see how the body reacts, then the risks should be little. 
    
#### reduce the spread of viruses    
reduce spread -> reduce opening and closing of alveoli i.e. deep breathing [[Larsson](#larsson)][to be confirmed and checked how relevant this is for pathogenesis][simulate first what happens]
- patients should breath as calm as possible
- slightly increased pressure may reduce opening and closing of alveoli [to be confirmed]
- ventilators possibly reduce the spread of particles [[Lindstedt and colleagues](#lindstedt)]
  
 




<!--
#### Mechanical Ventilators
Mechanically ventilated patients exhale less particles: "Mechanically ventilated patients exhibit decreased particle flow in exhaled breath as compared to normal breathing patients" by [Lindstedt and colleagues](#lindstedt). That has to be taken into account. 
[work in progress: To be investigated: it could mean that they shed less viruses and less viruses are distributed throughout the lungs or it could mean that more viruses stay in the lungs since there is less clearance. ]

### Appendix for Early On Ventilators
Just indications are listened and no statistical testing has been done. Some times correlations have been determined in the papers given as sources. Ideally the statistics takes into account correlations between the various factors too; e.g. there is likely a correlation between age and chronic heart disease]. [todo: math, check dependence between observables][todo: add average for entire populations as comparison]

#### Factors Associated to severe Covid-19:

* [Zhong et al.](#zhong) noted characteristics of hospital admitted Covid-19 patients which are grouped into mild, severe and fatal cases. 
The numbers in parenthesis are observation rates in % of (fatal cases, severe cases(including fatal), mild hospitalized)

    strong relation:
    - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10.4 vs 3.5 vs 0.6)

    weak relation:

* [Bhatraju et al.](#bhatraju) noted characteristics of Covid-19 patients from the Seattle-area with ARDS.

    strong relation:

    - high body mass index (33.2±7.2)
    - Age (64±18 (23–97))

    weak relation:
    - former/current smoker 22%

* In Italy [Onder et al.](#onder) analysed a subsample of 355 patients with COVID-19 who died in Italy: 

    strong relation:
    * mean age was 79.5 years (SD, 8.1) 
    * 117 patients (30%) had ischaemic heart disease
    * 126 (35.5%) had diabetes
    * 72 (20.3%) had active cancer
    * 87 (24.5%) had atrial fibrillation

    some relation:

* The Covid-19 fatality rates are higher in cities and especially in cities which are not known for very clean air. Many Covid-19 related deaths are recorded in: Madrid, Milano, Teheran, New York and Wuhan [citation to be added]. According to findings from [Wolff](#wolff) dirty air can reduce the mucus clearance in various ways. 
    
#### Factors Associated with ADRS in Influenza    
The following characteristics are observed in the  [paper from Yuen et al.](#yuen):
- For patient developing a ARDS coughing was more common than for patients, who didn't develop an ARDS. Since coughing is an emergency measure of the body to clear respiratory tract this an indication of bad clearance. 
- The Nasopharyngeal Viral load was even a little higher in the group, who didn't develop an ARDS.
- The tracheal viral load was much higher in the ARDS groups (less clearance!)
- Diabetis, Age, Chronic hear disease positively correlate with ARDS development. 
    
    
#### factors influencing the mucus flow

* [Nakagawa et al.](#nakagawa) found that "Ageing, Diabetes, and Hypertension Are Associated With Decreased Nasal Mucociliary Clearance". The mechanisms of mucus production in the nose are likely similar to those in the trachea and therefore similar associations are expected [to be confirmed]. 

* In the review from [Houtmeyers et al.](#houtmeyers) "Regulation of mucociliary clearance in health and disease" has references to findings which indicate a decreased mucus flow and ciliary activity with age. 

* Dry Air especially below 50% relative humidity decreases the mucus flow in the trachea. Observed by [Forbes](#forbes)  for greyhounds under barbiturate anaesthesia breathing air at 37 °C.

* [Leopold et al.](#leopold-mahony-lian) observed smoking-associated shorter airway epithelial cilia which, according to their argumentation, yields a decreased mucus flow (described in the section "Implications of Reduction of Cilia Length on Mucociliary Clearance"). 

* In his review on ["Effects of Airborne Pollutants on Mucociliary Clearance"](#wolff)  Ronald K. Wolff summarizes "A variety of pollutants have been shown to impair mucociliary clearance following acute or subchronic exposures." 



#### humidity related death rates

* Around the world fewer deaths per capita in humid air countries indicating a lower death-rate. There is a lower death-rate in Singapore/Kuwait/Qatar/Isreal than in Island/Norway, countries which have a good health care system and do widespread testing ([data specifications](#data specifications)). 
    - __Remark__: Norway and Isreal probably get half of the cases tested positive, so the death rate should be divided by 2. 
    - __Remark__: Mucus clearance may not be the only reason for lower death rates in humid air, but also that [Dry Form Infection](#abstract) is less likely and therefore Covid-19 starts more in the trachea than in the alveolis. 

* In a analysis ["Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China"](#luo) Luo et al. find a correlation in a time series analysis between a decreased humidity and and increased death rates (which likely corresponds to lowering the ARDS risk). The argumentation given here provides a possible explanation for their findings. The analysis depends however, on how accurate and consistent the analysed data are. In nearly all heavy hit regions around the world, the priority was and is and should be to save lives and not to count accurately. Remark: To recent news, the deaths published in Wuhan were those  in hospitals. This data is consistent and even preferred to analyse to impact of humidity ([data specifications](#data specifications)).

# Transmission of Sars-CoV-2 with Focus on a Proposed Dry Form Transmission 

<p id="abstract">-----</p>

## Abstract Proposed Dry Form Transmission
A dry form transmission model for Betacoronaviruses is proposed. It is known that Sars-CoV-1 has the unusual ability for viruses to survive in dry form, this makes a dry form transmission possible and also likely to occur since evolutionary drive is needed to develop this ability.
The transmission models described in the literature - a recent recommended review is [Herfst](#herfst) - for viruses are:
* Contact (direct and indirect via fomites)
* Droplets
* Aerosols

this new model is added:
* Dry form transmission 

Compared to aerosols - which tend to spread local both in time and space, an example is the scent of a freshly cooked soup -, tiny dry particulates behave smoke like - smoke is a collection of tiny dry particulates diffusing around - so they can diffuse around and stay in the air even longer. Dry particulates have a potentially more infectious lung deposition and less clearance. 

It is argued 
* the described properties of dry form transmission explain well the observed transmission patterns for Sars-CoV-1/2. 
* the entry receptor of Sars-CoV-1/2 (ACE2) distribution in body tissues and the observed viral load in different organs indicate that Sars-CoV-1/2 has the lower respiratory tract as the main entry point.  Particle deposition at inhalation, which shows that mainly aerosols and dry particulates are entering the lower respiratory tract, suggests that these two are the main transmitters of  Sars-CoV-1/2. Viral load in the pharynx can be attributed to deposition of particles upon exhalation. 

Overall the argumentation provides evidence, that the most relevant transmission models are aerosol and the proposed dry form. 

Based on the aerosol and dry form transmission models, expected spread patterns are discussed and the smoke-like transmission metaphor.  Measures for controlling the Sars-CoV-2 transmission are outlined. Key is ventilation of indoor spaces and wearing a mask in risky indoor spaces. 



<p id="model">-----</p>

## Models for Transmission

In the following, a new model of dry form transmission of Sars-CoV-1 and Sars-CoV-2 is proposed. The virus is attached to dry particulates or even just as a single particle. These dry particles dust like fly around or in the case of tiny particulates diffuse smoke like around. This yields a different transmission pattern than the aerosol [[Tellier](#tellier)], which is however still a relevant transmission pathway. The droplet model is likely to be less relevant, since the Sars-CoV-2 [infects primarily cells in the lower respiratory tract entry](#habitat-of-sars-cov-2) and [only small particulates reach the deep lungs](#particles).

In their very illustrative paper [Chan et al.](#chan) show that the Sars-CoV-1 keeps its infectiousness in dry form so the dry form infection is possible in theory.

The newly proposed infection:
* Dry Particulates in Air -> Lung

where Dry Particulate is a small particulate with one or more viruses attached or possibly viruses attached to each other. 

The above infection pathway is in addition to the known aerosol pathway:
* Aerosol with Virus in Air -> Respiratory Tract

Aerosols containing particulates and dry particulates can convert to each other in the air:

* Dry Particulates -> Small Aerosol containing a Particulate (more likely in humid air, particulates act as condensation nuclei)
* Dry Particulates <- Small Aerosol containing a Particulate (more likely in dry air)

and smaller aerosol can convert to larger (see e.g. Figure 3 (C) and (D) in [marr](#marr)): 
* Small Aerosol <-> Large Aerosol (in dry air equilibrium tends to the left, in humid to the right)


The larger tend to fall to the ground since their movement is driven more by gravity (e.g. described in [tellier](#tellier)). 

Infectious aerosols can get into the air from the lower or upper respiratory tract through breathing, coughing or speaking (section [exhaling particles](#particles-spreading). Remark: Viral load in the upper respiratory tract can be attributed to [depositions](#particles-deposition) of viruses upon exhalation. This is exploited for Covid-19 swab tests in the pharynx. 

Dry particulates get into the air either by the above conversion from aerosols, probably directly from an infected lung [to be searched/calculated if this is possible, work in progress] or from dirt. Dirt can be from sedimented air particles or from faeces. [to check: vacuum cleaner particle filter size].  [to be checked if dirt is/can be relevant and what kind of dirt]

##### and Source
* source = lung for a,b
* source = faeces [evidence from ] and possibly the lung (calculations are on the way whether the relative humidity in the lung can be low enough)
* source can also be indirect. However one has to keep in mind that for the probability to be in two digit percentages there need to be many infectious particulates in the air.

<p id="particles">-----</p>

## Intermezzo: Particle Dynamics in the Respiratory Tract
Conversational remarks about how I understand particle deposition models. 

Particle deposition and clearance are possibly relevant for Covid-19 in view of:
* infection pathway
* spread within the lower respiratory tract (pathogenesis)
* spread to the pharynx (swab test and transmission)
* spread out of the body (transmission)
* depositions of medicaments for the treatment

### particles spreading 
This section describes when particles are exhaled and how they spread out within the respiratory tract. 
* Larger particles i.e. droplet are mostly spread at coughing and speaking. Coughing yields mostly particles from the upper respiratory tract. 

* Small particles from the lower respiratory tract (<1 micro meter) are spread with breathing alone and not when speaking or coughing. [Larsson et al](#larsson) found this by identifying the origins of particles from the lipid composition. 

* [fabian et al](#fabian) found that the number of particles exhaled is very individual. Differences greater than a factor of 500 were observed. A tendency for a positive correlation with age was observed. 

* [milton et al](#milton2018) observed that the aerosol amount exhaled correlated both with coughing and BMI. Coughing correlated with RNA shedding. However, without coughs, there are small infectious aerosols exhaled too. 

So Covid-19 can be spread with breathing alone especially since in the deep lungs there are many receptors for Sars-CoV-2.  


### particles deposition
This section describes how particles are deposited in the respiratory tract. These particles can originate from other locations in the respiratory tract or being inhaled from extern air.

How many particles are deposited/breath out in which region in/from the respiratory tract depends on various factors ([park et al](#park) have recently written a review): 

##### factors 
- particles properties such as diameter, density, form (see [sturm](#sturm)) and material([zhong18](#zhong18)])
- breathing volume and frequency [hofemeier](#hofemeier)
- air humidity and how much the air is moistened in the lung. E.g. described in an article by [zhong18](#zhong18)]
- orientation respect to gravity i.e. wether horizontal or vertical
The physiology of the airways is such that particles are absorbed and cleared out as early as possible and the heavier the earlier [Stuart](#stuart), [Balley](#bailey), [Kleinstreuer](#kleinstreuer). 

##### deposition locations

- Droplets mostly don't enter the lower respiratory tract.
- Small Aerosols can enter the lower respiratory tract. But at a size of at least 0.1 μm they are not well deposited (the Sars-CoV-2 diameter is between 50 and 200 nm) and larger aerosols are quite well cleared out [to be confirmed and citation to be added]. 
- Tiny, dry and sticky (Spike-Glycoprotein) particulates may have a higher deposition rate on the lung alveolar epithelial cells (see section [deposition](#deposition-locations) and less clearance [to be confirmed and citation to be added, work in progress].


* Locations of particles depositions for different sizes both a inhale and exhale are shown in [Kleinstreuer et al](#kleinstreuer) on page 23 are used: "Fig. 6. Particle deposition in human nasopharyngeal model: (a) nasopharyngeal; (b) tracheal; (c) generation 1; (d) generation 2; and (e) generation 3". Especially noteworthy is that upon exhale many particles are deposited in the pharynx (which is relevant for swab tests). 

* [Zhong](#zhong) et al describe that the particles can be moistened upon inhale and this has an effect on depositions locations. 

* The particles depositions aren't equal for the left and right lung and bronchus [Rahimi-Gorji](#rahimi-gorji), [kleinstreuer2017](#kleinstreuer2017)

* Particle deposition in the alveolar regions can be greatly increased upon deep inhaling [hofemeier](#hofemeier).

* [Sturm](#sturm) simulated the deposition of  non-spherical particles particles. The form factor showed to matter most for larger particles in the size of 10 micro meter. Fibers in that size were deposited early on, where as disks showed the highest deposition rate in the airway generations 20 to 25. 

### particles clearance
[in work]
##### Methods of Clearance
* clearance by mucus flow towards the alimentary system
* clearance by macrophages in the epithelium and in the mucus[to check]
* absorption in the alveoli and clearance via the blood stream
* coughing

##### factors influencing clearance
* well flowing mucus (see [factors increasing the mucus flow](#factors-influencing-the-mucus-flow))
* the earlier deposited the better is the mucus clearance
* particle properties such as material (bad clearance for insoluble), form, size

### simulation methods and experiments
In her thesis [Lindstrom](#lindstrom) explains well the principles. A recent review is from [Park and colleagues](#park). An often used model is the [ICRP Model](#bailey).

Modeling or experimentally determine the deposition rates is not easy and each method has caveats.  

##### Simulations
The airflow in the lung has variations and is complicated [Tsuda](#tsuda), [Bailey](#bailey). Often good agreement for modeling methods compared to in vivo measurements are shown, however many estimates for parameters have to be taken and thus overfitting could occur. Additionally many simplifications of relevant [factors](#factors) both for respiratory tract and particles are taken: Most modeling methods ignore the softness and dynamics of the respiratory system, except a few see [darquenne](#darquenne). Particle shape(taken into account in [sturm](#sturm)), condensation and material (both discussed in [Zhong18](#zhong18)) are mostly ignored, i.e. the simulations are done for round constant size aerosol droplets.

Traditional methods go: Model the respiratory tract as a static pipe system and do the physics [Stuart 84](#stuart),  [ICRP by Bailey](#bailey). These methods yield some differential equations. These equations are often solved/simulated with a computer-based approach e.g. Monte Carlo methods. 

Recent approaches model the respiratory tract accurately in 3D and make use of advances in computational fluid dynamics. Examples are [kleinstreuer](#kleinstreuer), [qi](#qi), [rahimi-gorji](#rahimi-gorji), [zhong18](#zhong18).

##### Experiments
- Experimental in vitro setting: Build an artificial lung and measure: [sznitman](#sznitman). 

- Experimental in vivo settings:
    * A person inhales aerosols and the deposited fraction is measured. Recent experiments are done by [Rissler et al](#rissler).
    * A person inhales some test particles and the number of absorbed particles is measured for different volumes inhaled. For small volumes, the air goes not fare into to lung and so for this part the absorption is calculated. Then the volume is increased, the adsorbed particles measured again and the next part of the lung is calculated: the previous result is subtracted and the remaining adsorption is the next deeper lung part  [reference to be added].
    * Experimental data on the regional deposition of radio-labelled aerosol particles can be derived from gamma camera images.  The limited resolution of the planar image allows no separation between the peripheral and the bronchial airways. This separation can be done by measuring the particle clearance kinetics during the first few days after inhalation[reference to be added].

## Evidence for the Dry Form Transmission Model

<p id="biological-properties">---</p>

### Evidence from Biological Properties

From the [Habitat of the Betacoronavirus](#habitat) lower respiratory tract entry for Sars-CoV-1/2 is obligate for infection. As described in [deposition locations](#deposition-locations) only aerosols and tiny dry particulates enter the lower respiratory tract. So the two primary transmission forms are aerosol and dry form. Since aerosols usually are cleared quite well with the mucus flow, the dry form is likely more infectious. 


<p id="spread-patterns">---</p>
    
### Evidence from the observed Spread Patterns

The aerosol transmission explains well the observed spread patterns of influenza. Dust like spreading is explaining better following observations for the observed Betacoronaviruses spread patterns than the aerosol model:

In confined settings without special protection reproduction numbers well above the number of close contacts a person has, have been observed [Mizumoto](#mizumoto). Which is not very likely to observe with the aerosol transmission model. Since the movement of aerosols is affected by gravitation and therefore their concentration in the air quite rapidly decreases (see [model](#model) section). The movement of dry dust, on the other hand, is less affected by gravity which yields longer remaining in the air. The events of very high spreading have all been observed in cool outside temperature and heated indoor spaces which means dry and confined air. In theses settings dry dust like spreading is possible:
* Sars-CoV-1:
	- Hospitals in China [Mizumoto](#mizumoto)
    -  Long-Term Care Facility in Seattle [Honein et al](#honein)
	- Hotel in Hong Kong, especially during cooler outside temperatures [Lin](#lin), [Chan](#chan)


* Sars-CoV-2:
	- Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan [Mizumoto](#mizumoto). This setting well investigated by Mizumoto and colleagues favours airborne over droplet transmission and even slightly favours Dry Form over aerosol transmission since the Covid-19 spread started between passengers and not equally between passengers and personal:
        * In the droplet model, one would except the personal as a angle and starting point, since they have the most close contacts, which drive droplet transmission. 
        * In the aerosol model about an equal spread would be expected. Experience from cooking smells teaches us, that aerosols tend to spread out locally.
        * Smoke diffuses entire rooms and tends to stay quite long, so spending much time in the same confined rooms is more relevant than interactions or being close but only for a short period. Therefor an initial spread in passengers is expected since they spend the time in the same areas. 
	- Music Club in Japan (see Introduction [Mizumoto](#mizumoto))
	- Church in Korea (see Introduction [Mizumoto](#mizumoto))
	- Hospitals in Nothern Italy [LE](#le)
	Mers-Cov:
	- Main spreading in Winter season and in generally dry areas.
The primary spreading in very dry (indoor) areas would also explain why the described coronaviruses diseases occurred recently, even though overall hygiene increased.  


* In settings without prior SARS experience the infection rate in health care workers is very high:
	* 2003 in South East Asia  (see Introduction [Mizumoto](#mizumoto))
	* 2019/2020 in Europe - Italy especially [LE](#le)<br>
	
	Possible Explanation: The medical staff is used to protect against aerosol infections and know to handle them. However, they are not yet used to the new spreading pattern. Consequently in all rooms of the building wearing a mask likely is key in reducing the infection rates (many cities in China reported few infections in hospitals [citation to be added]).
    
    
    
#### Further evidences

Remark: The following pieces of evidence are 'in work'. 

* In humid and warm temperature environments (above 30 degrees), there are no known events of a step increase in death numbers. [Chan](#chan) shows that warm temperatures of 33 Celsius and high relative don't yield a much faster rate of inactivation; temperatures over 38 degrees do induce a much faster inactivation [11]. A possible explanation why in humid conditions around 33 degrees there no super-spreading events observed is: In humid environments, organic particles act as condensation nuclei and therefore loose their dry form. So viruses "find" themselves within aerosols. In this case, an aerosol like spreading pattern with no super-spreading events would be expected. 

* The initial animal to human of  Sars-CoV-2 occurred in a setting of cold outside temperature and therefore dry indoor air, namely likely in the Wuhan Sea Food market. Pictures of the market suggest that the market is partly indoor and therefore likely heated. Similar transmission settings from animal to human have been likely the case for Sars-CoV-1 [citation to be added] and MERS (probably indoor camel riding arena) animal to human jumps. 


<p id="metaphor-and-measures">---</p>

## Metaphor and Measures 
When avoiding the influenza aerosol spread is avoiding somebody’s reek of alcohol, then in the dry form model, this corresponds to avoiding a smoker's smoke. The latter is much more difficult since smoke remains in the air for much longer and can diffuse to other rooms. 
Just smelling would be the theoretical possibility of an infection. But for the odds to be in two digits percentages, one needs likely to be that close to a person that the cloths would be smelling. 
Another form of dry particulates in air is dust. In dry air dust can stay in the very long and travel long distances. Outside no worry for Sars-CoV-2 however, it is diluted and sun light destroys virions. 

This yields either avoiding Sars-CoV-2 containing smoke entirely or filtering out  particulates above a few hundreds nanometers (Sars-CoV-2 is about between 80-150 nm, but likely it is attached so some organic material[to check and cite]). Keeping the smoke metaphor in mind, then indoor ventilation and indoor wearing a mask are key. Measures in more detail are found in [Protection Measures](#measures).
