## Recent Topics Added
- 23.3. [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment: It reduces the number of infectious virions and enhances the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
- 23.3. Proposal of [Local Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)


## Recent Updates
- 27.4. Clarified Note [Comment on Comments](#comment-on-comments) and added note that unfitting formulations occur and are improved upon discovery in the section [Notes on Reading](#notes-on-reading).
- 25.4. Page coronaviruses separated into the pages:
  - [Life Forms](2_biological/life-forms.md). Principles and concepts of life on earth.
  - [Viruses](2_biological/viruses.md). What viruses are and what they can do and do.

## Notes on Reading
* Many parts are __hypothesis__ and __ideas__ but __not__ [double] checked facts. They are put here as ideas to be checked and evaluated. 
* Chapters with new or not well founded content are tagged with *(explorative)*.
* This page often conversational and some parts aren't rigorous and just ideas in raw form. 
* The page is in work. Parts under heavy work are mostly marked with '[in work]'. Mistakes of any form are likely.
* _License_ The license is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. Relaxation: For any use with the main purpose of public health and public information no attribution is needed (as long as its not copy & paste). <!-- in science citing/Referencing is a good and helpful practice.-->
* _Support_ [Support on ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/H2H72F6XY) is welcome, to enable full-time re-searching on coronaviruses.
* Questions, pointing out mistakes, improvement suggestions and feedback are __welcome__.
* _[Table of Content](#content)_ The content is ordered mostly by dependencies i.e. content founding other sections is ahead. The dependencies are often circular however.
* _Source_ This page is open source on GitHub: [https://github.com/forestgrape/coronavirus/blob/master/index.md](https://github.com/forestgrape/coronavirus/blob/master/index.md), where it can be read both as Markdown and GitHub Preview and hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://forestgrape.github.io/coronavirus](https://forestgrape.github.io/coronavirus)
* _References_
  * Often references are summarized. Word-by-word extracts are in "_ _ _". The summaries are biased towards to results relevant for this page. To capture the essence of the research is tried too.
  * As much as possible original work is referred. Sometimes reviews or remarks in introductions are referred which point further to the original work/articles.
  * The references are named by the first author. (In the beginning of this work sometimes references were named by the correspondence author or a descriptive tag).
  * References are usually grouped by topic. If several topics apply, one is chosen.
* _Formulations_
   Sometimes words are not weighted carefully or formulations are unclear e.g. ambiguous. If not formatted as comment/subjective remark, ambiguity is unintentional. Upon discovery, unfitting formulations are improve. Feedback is appreciated and questions welcome.

*   > ###### Definitions
    > *Definitions* are written like this and are valid throughout this page; sometimes only throughout this page. Redefinition of existing terms is not done on purpose, unless explicitly noted. Please point out!

*   > ###### Comments
    > *Comments*, often subjective, are formatted the same as [definitions](#definitions) and sometimes additionally marked with programming style '//'. Otherwise distinction is done by context/content.

    ##### Comment on Comments
    > Sometimes subjective comments and off topic comments are added. One reason for subjective comments is transparency and background for the mindset behind suggestions. 
    
    ##### Mindset in short
    > * *We all should be able to live the life we want, as long that's respecting the rest of the world doing so too.* ([Respect and Take Care](./1_introduction/suggestions_and_tips.md#respect-and-take-care) in the Suggestion and Tips chapter)
    > * Attitudes or group memberships, - in my view - and as long as they respect others - *only* matter if relevant for the task of interest. ([Clarification on Comments](./1_introduction/update_history.md#clarifications-on-comments) in the update history chapter)

## Content

> Sometimes out of date, newest sections are announced in [recent updates](#recent-updates)].


### Introductory Topics
* [Recent Updates](#recent-updates) and [Update History](./1_introduction/update_history.md)
* [Public Suggestions and Tips](./1_introduction/suggestions_and_tips.md)
    Keep distance and hygiene. Then outdoors is safe. Inside ventilate well and/or wear a mask. Transmission can be smoke-like. Don't burden the immune system.


### Biological Topics
- [Life Forms](2_biological/life-forms.md). Principles and concepts of life on earth.
  - [Motion](./2_biological/motion.md) How life form move or get moved to cross distances.
- [Viruses](2_biological/viruses.md). What viruses are and what they can do and do. Viruses are defined as life forms which are dependent on extern enzymes. Aspects such as life cycle and behavior are discussed.
  - [Virion Viability](./2_biological/virion_viability.md)
    * Virions decay fast in sunlight, soap and disinfectants (the halflife time is a few minutes).
    * From 0 to 40 degrees the decay is faster at increased temperature and depends on the biochemical environment. In saliva, nasal mucus and sputum the halflife time is about 8 hours at 4 degrees and about 2 hours at a room-temperature of 22 degrees.
    * Above 45 degrees the decay fastens and is less dependent on the biochemical environment since the spring-loaded proteins loose their energy.
    * A fast decay seems to occur in the presence of osmotic pressure e.g. when the concentration of salts is very low in the surrounding water. This is the case in distilled water and in situations with a lot of condensation.
- [Coronaviruses](2_biological/coronavirus.md). Life cycle, distinguishing features and capabilities of coronaviruses.
  - [Backtracing Sars-CoV-1/2](./2_biological/hosts_of_nidovirales.md#backtracing-sars-cov-12) (*explorative*)
    The natural habitat of SARS-CoV-1/2 includes domestic animals and insects in the region Northern Yunnan. The life cycle of SARS-like is alternating in hosts and follows nutrient cycles. 


### Medical Topics
* [Covid-19](3_medical/covid19.md)
    The Covid-19 results from the interplay between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 can infect different locations throughout the respiratory tract and  the immune response experienced depends on the location. Therefore Covid-19 is a disease with many faces. 
* [Diagnosis and Viral Load](3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md) How to diagnose Covid with a focus on methods detecting parts of viruses (virus RNA with PCR or virus proteins with antigen test) at different locations (e.g. in the nose, mouth, lungs).
- [Infection Locations and Disease Patterns](./3_medical/coronavirus_disease_patterns.md) (*explorative*)


### Immunological Topics
* [Immune System](4_immunological/immune_system.md)
  Selected topics of the immune protection with a focus protection versus coronaviruses are discussed. 
* [Immune Evasion](4_immunological/immune_evasion.md) How coronaviruses circumvent immune system obstacles.


### Epidemiological Topics 
* [Transmission of Sars-CoV-2 with Focus on a Proposed Dry Form Transmission](./5_epidemiological/transmission.md)
    Sars-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted airborne and even a Dry Form aerosol infection is possible.
    - A summary of airborne transmission, 
    - Proposal of a new dry from transmission model,
    - describe how particles behave in the respiratory tract,
    - analyse spread pattern of Covid-19 which indicate aerosol transmission
    - and based on the discussions protection measures are suggested: smoke protection and masks.
- [Spread Analyses](./5_epidemiological/spread_analyses.md) Situations where Covid-19 spreading is observed or is *not* observed are described. High transmission of severe Covid is observed in situations where much air is exchanged between people. Much air is exchanged when spending a lot time indoors without ventilation, crowded confined settings, at high altitude and when deep breathing (e.g. sports, singing).
- [Evidence for Increased Immune Protection against Sars-CoV-2 from Exposure to BCoVs](#evidence-for-increased-immune-protection-against-sars-cov-2-from-exposure-to-bcovs) (*explorative section*)


### Treatment and Prevention
- [Movement](6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md) How movement helps to get a better immune reaction upon a Covid infection and to recover faster and better.
- [Topical Treatments of the Respiratory Tract](6_prevention_and_treatment/topical_treatment.md) to prevent and cure respiratory infections including Covid. Coronaviruses (and other respiratory viruses) live on the surface of the respiratory tract and release their progeny as delicate virions to the covering fluids. The idea is to reduce these virions by local treatments. Similar as we disinfect wounds - the medications need to be adapted of course. (explorative)
  - [Temperature and Humidity Modulation](6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) is proposed as a topical treatment: It reduces the number of infectious virions and enhances the immune response. There is solid biological and epidemiological evidence that it works if used early on! (explorative)
  - [Increase the mucus Flow by humidified air](./6_prevention_and_treatment/increasing_the_mucus_flow.md): Humidify inhaled air early on to increase the mucus flow and wash the virions out. The goal is a reduce viral load and better prognosis. (explorative)


### Social Topics
* [Thoughts about Controlling Sars-CoV-2](7_social/controlling.md)
    Thoughts how to tackle and control Covid-19. Different kind of measures are discussed from physical (mask, ventilation) to social measures such as an early closure of nightlife.


### Data Topics
* [Monitoring](8_data/monitoring.md)
    About testing, monitoring, gathering and publishing data.
