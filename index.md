## Updates
- 25/26/27/30.3.20:  Corrected and looked up aerosol/particulate inhalation. 
    In the first version, I had written that aerosols don't enter the lungs. Aerosols DO enter the lungs. The train of thought yielding the first: Entering the lungs is halfway entering the body. So there must have been enough evolutionary pressure to prevent this. This is double wrong:
    1. The evolutionary roots of the lungs are the alimentary system, so substances coming in were just cleared down. Even as lungs and the alimentary separated this process stayed. As we often do too, evolution usually gradually bends things right, rather than rebuilding from scratch.  
    2. The lungs developed before we were upright and in the original case the clearance of aerosols earlier and better; shown for mice in [Kleinstreuer](#kleinstreuer). Ciliate based movement works even uphill, as ski tourers know. But there are limits. A workaround evolved: in humans, smallest particulates are cleared by macrophages [citation to be added].

## Public Advice

Do NOT take Covid-19 lightly: it can be very serious in the short-term and whether there are possible long-term effects is unknown.  
   
- The coronavirus transmission can be smoke-like. A neighbours candle won't harm through doors, but if you are at a place with an indoor barbecue (many people dry coughing), wearing a mask is important. This can be the case in a train with people coughing or in a hospital treating Covid-19 patients.

-    Wear a mask in all indoor places where infectious people can be or best avoid crowded indoor spaces entirely. Distancing also reduces infection risk. 
	Reuse the mask; but put it into 60 to 70-degree hot water for 30 minutes every day. [Chan et al.](#chan) have shown that this inactivates the coronavirus (Remark: shown for Sars-Cov-1). 
    
- Ventilate your rooms regularly by opening all windows for 5 minutes. [Ventilation](#ventilation) has been shown to be effective. Don't have very dry air inside; drying your frequently washed cloths inside keeps the air humid.

- Keep proper hygiene. Especially wash your hands well after toilet. 
Hygiene is important because:
   * transmission pathways of Covid-19 are still unclear. So currently just avoid them all. 
   * it is known that viruses causing common cold are transmitted through droplets. These viruses can weaken the immune system [[kikkert](#kikkert)] and therefore could induce an increased infection risk. 
   * avoiding a common cold or flu is important, because these have often similar early symptoms as Covid-19. This means quarantine for you and your close contacts and figuring out all people you could have infected and informing them.   
   
  But do <strong>not</strong> rely on hygiene alone, since there is strong evidence, that the majority of [transmissions occur through indoor air](#spread-patterns) and not with droplets. 

- Measure and observe your temperature several times every day and record the values. As a slightly increased temperature can be an early sign of a possible Sars-Cov-2 infection. Many people have only slightly increased temperature which doesn't "meet the definition of fever" [Zhang](#zhang), [Wong](#wong), [Zhong](#zhong). The more common Covid-19 in your region is, the more likely it is that an observed infection is Covid-19. In my case - South East Switzerland, a day hike away from Nothern Italy - Covid-19 is currently the most prevalent disease. 

- Live a healthy lifestyle 
    * sleep enough, eat healthily and do some sport
    
    and avoid anything that weakens your immune system:
    * avoid excessive caffeine, excessive sport (if in a risk region), excessive alcohol ...

## Abstract
A new dry form transmission model for Betaviruses is proposed. It is known that Sars-Cov-1 has the unusual ability for viruses to survive in dry form, this makes a dry form transmission possible and also likely to occur since evolutionary drive is needed to develop this ability.
The transmission models described in the literature - a recent recommended review is [Herfst](#herfst) - for viruses are:
* Contact (direct and indirect via fomites)
* Droplets
* Aerosols

this new model is added:
* Dry form transmission 

Compared to aerosols, tiny dry particulates can diffuse around smoke-like - smoke is a collection of tiny dry particulates diffusing around -, stay in the air even longer and may have a higher lung deposition fraction and less clearance. 

It is argued 
* the described properties of dry form transmission explain well the observed transmission patterns for Sars-Cov. 
* the entry receptor of Sars-Cov (ACE2) distribution and the observed viral loads in different organs indicate that Sars-Cov has the lower respiratory tract as the obligate entry point.  Particle deposition at inhalation, which shows that mainly aerosols and dry particulates are entering the lower respiratory tract, suggests that these two are the only Sars-Cov transmitters. The viral loads in the pharynx are in agreement with experiments showing that upon exhalation particles are deposited there. 

The overall argumentation suggests, that the most relevant transmission models are aerosol and the proposed dry form. 

Based on these findings, recommendations for containing the 2020 spread of Sars-Cov-2 are given. Key is indoor ventilation and wearing in 'risky' indoor spaces a mask. 

<p id=model>-----</p>

## Model

In the following, a model of dry form transmission of Sars-Cov-1 and Sars-Cov-2 is proposed. The virus is attached to dry particulates or even just as a single particle. These dry particles dust like fly around or in the case of tiny particulates diffuse smoke like around. This yields a different transmission pattern than the aerosol [[Tellier](#tellier)], which is however still a relevant transmission pathway. The droplet model is likely to be less relevant, due to the obligate lower respiratory tract [entry](#entry) for Sars-Cov-2. 

In their very illustrative paper [Chan et al.](#chan) show that the Sars-Cov-1 keeps its infectiousness in dry form so the dry form infection is possible in theory.

The newly proposed infection:
* Dry Particulates in Air -> Lung

where Dry Particulate is a small particulate with one or more viruses attached or possibly viruses attached to each other. 

The above infection pathway is in addition to the known aerosol pathway:
* Aersol with Virus in Air -> Respiratory Tract

Aerosols containing particulates and dry particulates can convert to each other in the air:

* Dry Particulates -> Small Aersol containing a Particulate (more likely in humid air, particulates act as condensation nuclei)
* Dry Particulates <- Small Aersol containing a Particulate (more likely in dry air)

and smaller aerosol can convert to larger (see e.g. Figure 3 (C) and (D) in [marr](#marr)): 
* Small Aerosol <-> Large Aerosol (in dry air equilibrium tends to the left, in humid to the right)


The larger tend to fall to the ground since their movement is driven more by gravity. 

Dry particulates get into the air either by the above conversion from aerosols, probably directly from an infected lung [to be searched/calculated if this is possible, work in progress] or from dirt. Dirt can be from sedimented air particles on the floor or fomites or from faeces. [to check: vacuum cleaner particle filter size].  [to be improved and check if dirt is relevant]

Infectious aerosols can get into the air from the lower or upper respiratory tract through breathing, coughing or speaking [citation to be added]. In the upper respiratory tract there are viruses since particles exhaled from the lung are often [deposited](#depositions) in the upper respiratory tract. This is exploited for Covid-19 swab tests in the pharynx.

* target = lung for a,b,c [see entry-point](#entry-point) for infection

##### and Source
* source = lung for a,b
* source = faeces [evidence from ] and possibly the lung (calculations are on the way whether the relative humidity in the lung can be low enough)
* source can also be indirect. However one has to keep in mind that for the probability to be in two digit percentages there need to be many infectious particulates in the air.

#### Intermezzo Particle Deposition and Clearance in the Respiratory Tract
Conversational remarks about how I understand particle deposition models. 

Particle deposition and clearance are possibly relevant for Covid-19 in view of:
* infection pathway
* spread within the lower respiratory tract (pathogenesis)
* spread to the pharynx (swab test and transmission)
* spread out of the body (transmission)
* depositions of medicaments for the treatment


How many particles are deposited/absorbed in which region of the respiratory tract depends on various factors ([park et al](#park) have recently written a review). 

##### factors
- particles properties such as diameter, density, form and material
- breathing volume and frequency
- air humidity and how much the air is moistened in the lung. E.g. described in an article by [zhong18](#zhong18)]
- orientation respect to gravity i.e. wether horizontal or vertical
<br><br>

##### depositions
There are [various methods](#methods) for the calculation of particulates depositions. For this work the deposition rates both for inhale and exhale shown in [Kleinstreuer et al](#kleinstreuer) on page 23 are used: "Fig. 6. Particle deposition in human nasopharyngeal model: (a) nasopharyngeal; (b) tracheal; (c) generation 1; (d) generation 2; and (e) generation 3". [diagram to be added]

##### methods
Modeling or experimentally determine the deposition rates is not easy and each method has drawbacks. The airflow in the lung has variations and is complicated [Tsuda](#tsuda), [Bailey](#bailey). In her thesis [Lindstrom](#lindstrom) explaines well the principles. 

Often good agreement for modeling methods compared to 'in vivo' measurements are shown, however quite many estimates for parameters have to be taken and thus overfitting could occur. Additionally, most modeling methods ignore the softness and dynamics of the respiratory system - some newer take it into account to some extent [darquenne](#darquenne).

- Model the respiratory tract as a static pipe system and do the physics [Stuart 84](#stuart),  [Bailey](#bailey). An often used such model has been done by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [Bailey 94](#bailey). These methods yield some differential equations. These equations can be solved/simulated with a computer-based approach e.g. Monte Carlo methods. 

    Recent approaches model the respiratory tract accurately in 3D and make use of advances in computational fluid dynamics e.g. [kleinstreuer](#kleinstreuer), [qi](#qi), [rahimi-gorji](#rahimi-gorji), [zhong18](#zhong18).
- Experimental in vivo settings:
    * A person inhales aerosols and the deposited fraction is measured. Recent experiments are done by [Rissler et al](#rissler).
    * A person inhales some test particles and the number of absorbed particles is measured for different volumes inhaled. For small volumes, the air goes not fare into to lung and so for this part the absorption is calculated. Then the volumina is increased, the adsorbed particles measured again and the next part of the lung is calculated: the previous result is subtracted and the remaining adsorption is the next deeper lung part  [refernce to be added].
    * Experimental data on the regional deposition of radiolabelled aerosol particles can be derived from gamma camera images.  The limited resolution of the planar image allows no separation between the peripheral and the bronchial airways. This separation can be done by measuring the particle clearance kinetics during the first few days after inhalation[reference to be added].
- Experimental in vitro setting: Build an artificial lung and measure: [sznitman](#sznitman).

## Evidence for the Dry Form Transmission Model

<p id=biological-properties>---</p>

### Evidence from Biological Properties
#### entry-point
The cell entry receptor used by SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 is ACE2 [LiF](#lif),[Hoffmann](#hoffmann),[Jiang](#jiang). ACE2 is apically expressed on lung alveolar epithelial cells [Timens](#timens). In the upper respiratory tract, only the basal layer of the non-keratinized squamous epithelium of the nasal and oral mucosa and the nasopharynx expresses ACE2 [Timens](#timens),[Lau](#lau). Both the barrier function of the apical cell layer and the fact that another Coronavirinae, namely 229E, infects the cells from the apical surface [[McCray](#mccray)], indicate that this is the case too for Betacoronaviruses. Therefore - to achieve infection - SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 need to enter the lower respiratory tract. 

This is consistent with the viral loads observed in different parts of the body: The only location where all patients had viral loads is the lungs [Farcas et al](#farcas). That in swab tests there are viruses in the nose and the mouth can be attributed to breathing them out. [Kleinstreuer et al](#kleinstreuer) have shown that upon exhale particles are deposited in the nose. An active infection in the upper respiratory tract would likely yield viral loads in the lymph nodes too [to be confirmed, citation needed].   

From the above argumentation lower respiratory tract entry for Sars-Cov-1/2 is obligate for infection. 
The physiology of the airways is such that particles are absorbed and cleared out as early as possible and the heavier the earlier [Stuart](#stuart), [Balley](#bailey), [Kleinstreuer](#kleinstreuer). 
- Droplets mostly don't enter the lower respiratory tract.
- Small Aerosols can enter the lower respiratory tract. But at a size of at least 0.1 μm they are not well deposited (the Sars-Cov-2 diameter is between 50 and 200 nm) and larger aerosols are quite well cleared out [to be confirmed and citation to be added]. 
- Tiny, dry and sticky (Spike-Glycoprotein) particulates may have a higher deposition rate on the lung alveolar epithelial cells and less clearance [to be confirmed and citation to be added, work in progress]. <br><br>

<p id=spread-patterns>---</p>
    
#### Evidence from the observed Spread Patterns

The aerosol transmission explains well the observed spread patterns of influenza. Dust like spreading is explaining better following observations for the observed Betacoronaviruses spread patterns than the aerosol model:

* In confined settings without special protection reproduction numbers well above the number of close contacts a person has, have been observed [Mizumoto](#mizumoto). Which is not very likely to observe with the aerosol transmission model. Since the movement of aerosols is affected by gravitation and therefore their concentration in the air quite rapidly decreases \[citation to be added]. The movement of dry dust, on the other hand, is less affected by gravity and therefore remains in the air much longer. The events of very high spreading have all been observed at relative cold outside temperature and therefore dry indoor air, so dry dust like spreading is possible:
	Sars-Cov-1:
	- Hospitals in China [Mizumoto](#mizumoto)
    - Hospital in Seattle [to added]
	- Hotel in Hong Kong, especially during cooler outside temperatures [Lin](#lin), [Chan](#chan)
	
	Sars-Cov-2:
	- Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan [Mizumoto](#mizumoto)
	- Music Club in Japan (see Introduction [Mizumoto](#mizumoto))
	- Church in Korea (see Introduction [Mizumoto](#mizumoto))
	- Hospitals in Nothern Italy [LE](#le)
	Mers-Cov:
	- Main spreading in Winter season and in generally dry areas.
The primary spreading in very dry (indoor) areas would also explain why the described coronaviruses diseases occurred recently, even though overall hygiene increased.  
* In settings without prior SARS experience the infection rate in health care workers is very high:
	* 2003 in South East Asia  (see Introduction [Mizumoto](#mizumoto))
	* 2019/2020 in Europe - Italy especially [LE](#le)<br>
	
	Possible Explanation: The medical staff is used to protect against aerosol infections and know to handle them. However, they are not yet used to the new spreading pattern. Consequently in all rooms of the building wearing a mask likely is key in reducing the infection rates (many cities in China reported few infections in hospitals \[citation to be added]).
#### Further evidences
Remark: The following pieces of evidence are 'in work'. 
* In humid and warm temperature environments (above 33 degrees), there are no known events of a step increase in death numbers. [Chan](#chan) shows that warm temperatures of 33 Celsius and high relative don't yield a much faster rate of inactivation; temperatures over 38 degrees do induce a much faster inactivation [11]. A possible explanation why in humid conditions around 33 degrees there no super-spreading events observed is: In humid enviroments, organic particles act as condensation nuclei and therefore loose their dry form. So viruses "find" themselves within aerosols. In this case, an aerosol like spreading pattern with no super-spreading events would be expected. 

* The initial animal to human of  Sars-Cov-2 occurred in a setting of cold outside temperature and therefore dry indoor air, namely likely in the Wuhan Sea Food market. Pictures of the market suggest that the market is partly indoor and therefore likely heated. Similar transmission settings from animal to human have been likely the case for Sars-Cov-1 [citation to be added] and MERS (probably indoor camel riding arena) animal to human jumps. 


<p id=measures>-----</p>

### Suggested Protections Measures 
Supposing that the main transmission of Sars-Cov-2 is either aerosol or dry form, which is <strong>not</strong> yet confirmed.

When avoiding the influenza aerosol spread is avoiding somebody’s reek of alcohol, then in the dry form model, this corresponds to avoiding a smoker's smoke. The latter is much more difficult since smoke remains in the air for much longer and can diffuse to other rooms. 
Just smelling would be the theoretical possibility of an infection. But for the odds to be in two digits percentages, one needs likely to be that close to a person that the cloths would be smelling. 

This yields either avoiding Sars-Cov-2 containing smoke entirely or filtering out most particulates above 200 nm (probably above 1000 nm is enough). Keeping the metaphor in mind that the right indoor ventilation and indoor wearing a mask is key. See [public-advice](#public-advice).

#### ventilation (work in progress)

* [Escombe et al](#escombe) show natural ventilation is a valid measure and that in the first few minutes of opening the windows a major part of air is exchanged ([escombe: Figure 1](#https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040068.g001)).
* [Salathe et al](#salathe) simulate both the airborne and droplet spread of influenza, using observed contact patters of students. They find that good ventilation can be as effective as vaccinating around half of the population.

### Respiratory Tract and Aerosol/Particle Deposition at In/Exhalation</strong>

[park](#park) is a recent review. An often used model is the [ICRP Model](#bailey). In this work mostly [kleinstreuer](#kleinstreuer) is used. [heyder](#heyder) is a readable description and [lindstrom](#lindstrom) explains very well the overall topic in her 40 pages long thesis. [qi](#qi) shows that particle deposition is individual and may change in case of lung diseases.
