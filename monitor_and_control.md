## Strategy 
> Mind set I follow to tackle SARS-CoV-2:
> * communication and explanation 
> * knowledge & research
> * taking own responsibility and independent decisions
> * Moderate measures preserving life quality. 
> * Focus on overall life quality. This includes keeping overall health effects in mind: in numbers, possible damage, life quality cost (which can include economic costs). <!--// for things harmful and/or unwanted, advertisements should be banned. It is always about acquiring new customers into an industry and not about competing on existing customers else the industry would cheer on saving ad costs. -->
> * settings that those who want/need can protect to some extent, while most (those not needing/choosing) can go on, go on circumspectly
> * but strictly avoiding uncontrollable spread hospital overwhelming. Since it is hard for all the affected: the relatives, the medical staff and the patients. At times when shops, restaurants and bars are open and crowded, considering and even risking to not admit elderly to hospitals in a few weeks time I think is **not** nice. **Everybody has to right for good treatment.** Restaurant and bars can and should be left often for those living/working alone or not working (e.g. due to Covid) or needing them for other reasons, but for most gastronomy is luxury dispensable for a few weeks. 
> 
> If hospitals are filling and the deaths increase, it is time to tighten the rules ([more on numbers](#on-numbers)).
>
> ### Reconsidering Strategy
> In cold areas/times rules need to be tighter, since aerosol transmission is hard to prevent. In warm areas window should be open and air-conditioning should not be used.
> 
> Two more points
> * trying new paths even at the risk of falling but with a parachute ready and using it early. Better walking back awkwardly with the parachute (and being ready for the next journey) than falling cool without. For Covid-19 the emergency parachutes are outdoor days: which means stopping all non essential entries to foreign or public indoor settings. 
> * Missteps should be analyzed, the next antibiotics can be discovered.  


## Protection Measures
The following relies on the assumption that the main transmission of Sars-CoV-2 is [airborne](./transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission) (either droplet, aerosol or dry form transmission). This is not yet confirmed. Evidence for dry form transmission is described in [Proposal of a Dry Form Transmission Model](./transmission.md). Airborne transmissions can be thought [smoke like](./transmission.md#metaphor-and-measures) or like the reek of alcohol in the case of droplet transmission. For the first non-smokers protections measures are suitable and for the latter distancing is enough.

### Support Immune Protection
Completely avoiding Sars-CoV-2 can be as hard as avoiding dust and smoke. This is hard. Even in laboratory settings virus protection is difficult [[Wurtz, Raoult et al](#raoult), [Artika and Ma'roef](#artika)] and  Sars-CoV-1/2 protection is especially difficult. There have been several cases of infections in labs with Sars-CoV-1 [Orellana et al](#orellana), [Lim et al](#lim) and recommendations for autopsies of Covid-19 fatalities are very strict [Finegan et al](#finegan). Out of labs, once a coronavirus is widespread, complete avoidance is nearly impossible. Sars-Cov-2 is widespread. The best protection available is a good immune system. Vaccines - if once available - just prepare the immune system and do not replace it. So the long-term focus should be to support the overall health of humanity. In tropical regions where Sars-CoV-2 infects less virulent but there are many more infectious diseases, this should be the main focus. 
[in work]
Proposals for good health:
* providing settings that support good health
    - allow people outside to move
    - environmental protection including clean air
* lessen stress 
    - secure and affordable life including basic health care
    - less pressure overall
* healthy nutrition 
* providing information and tips to focus on health and the immune system

Covid is just one of many reasons good health - including an intact immune system - is important.


### Masks
Mask reduce spread since they mitigate both the infection and spread risk. Masks should be changed frequently, but they can be [reused](#mask-reuse-and-cleaning) later on. 

#### Mask Usage
* For self protection good fit and a good outside-to-inside filter are important. 
* To avoid person to person droplet transmission e.g. when speaking, consequent wearing in close distance face-to-face situations is necessary. 
* In heated indoor rooms aerosol transmission can occur:
  * changing/disinfecting the masks frequently is necessary to prevent the spread of aerosols, especially for [low and mid filtration masks](#filter-performance)
  * [high filtration masks](#high-filtration) are needed to reliably filter aerosols
* After coughing or sneezing into mask changing is necessary. After speaking a lot into a mask changing is appropriate. Especially [low and mid filter models](#filter-performance).
* Some mask have a to big air resistance, in that case the air can bypasses the mask. There's still protection against droplets, essentially they are like wearable plexiglas. But bypassed air still contains [aerosols](./transmission.md#aerosol)


#### Mask Effectiveness
* [Milton et al.](#milton2013) measured the influenza viruses spread from patients with and without wearing a surgical mask. They found:
    - Particles greater than 5 micro meter: Surgical masks nearly eliminated viral RNA detection in the coarse aerosol fraction: resulting in a 25 fold reduction in the number of viral copies 
    - Particles smaller than 5 micro meter:  statistically significant 2.8 fold reduction in viral copies detected in the fine aerosol fraction.
    - Overall: Surgical masks significantly reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold.
    
    > [in rework] Assuming a reduction of exhaled particles by a factor of 2.5 (60% reduction) and a reduction by a factor 2 (50% reduction) for inhaling: everybody wearing a mask yields a total reduction factor of 5 = (2 times fewer particles inhaled) * (2.5 times fewer particles in the air since fewer exhaled) for aerosol transmission. This can yield a significant reduction of transmission in public indoor rooms (e.g. Supermarkets or Public Transport). <!--This would be a greater reduction in the reproduction factor than  observed for other measures. A factor 5 reduction would be enough to reduce the reproduction factor below 1 if an initial value of 4 is estimated (an estimate from the imperial college in London by Ferguson, Bhatt et al](#ferguson-bhatt).[in work]-->

#### Mask Types
Mask can be classified either by
* [Filter Performance](#filter-performance)
* [Usage Classes](#usage-classes)


##### Filter Performance
The filtration performance specifies how much and which particles are filtered out of the air at some fixed airflows and pressures. 
There are various standards to classify mask by their filtration quality: E.g. in Europe the FFP norms are common, in the US N95/P95 (e.g. Wikipedia page on FFP standards). The face-to-face talking droplets spread which is the most prevalent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is prevented by all filtration levels. High filtration is needed in situations where [aerosol transmission](./transmission.md#summary-airborne-transmission) are relevant. 
* ###### High Filtration
  FFP2 (Europe), N95(US), KN95(China). Generally high filtration mask also have a good fit, since if the air sidelines the mask, no aerosols are hold back regardless of the filter (droplets are still hold back). 
  
  * N95 (United States NIOSH-42CFR84)
  * FFP2 (Europe EN 149-2001)
  * KN95 (China GB2626-2006)
  * P2 (Australia/New Zealand AS/NZA 1716:2012)
  * Korea 1st class (Korea KMOEL - 2017-64)
  * DS2 (Japan JMHLW-Notification 214, 2018)
  
* ###### Intermediate Filtration
  Surgical Masks
* ###### Low Filtration 
  Textile mask often have low filter performance. They prevent the [droplet exchange](./transmission.md#droplets) when face-to-face talking and offer some self protection regarding aerosols. However, they do not reliably prevent the spread of aerosols, which is important in heated indoor rooms if possibly infected. 

##### Usage Classes
* _Protection masks against dust_ are constructed for outside-in protection and therefore good for self protection. Sometimes they have valves which let the air out unfiltered. That means that there is not inside to outside protection and thus masks with valves offer protection for the wearer only and *not* for others.
* _Medical masks_ : There are two types of medical mask. 
  * _Surgical masks_: are constructed for comfort and a focus is on inside to outside protection (during surgery, the body is open and so there is no skin protection). Mainly larger particles such as bacteria are filtered and additionally they cover the entire mouth area where often some nutrition rests can be.
  * _Medical protections masks_: To protect medical staff against pathogens from infected patients. These masks are usually in the highest filtration category and offer good protection for all pathogens including viruses.
* _Textile masks_ are available in a lot of sizes and styles. These masks often offer the best fit and tend worn most often due to comfort and style. The [filtration performance](#filter-performance) is often [low](#low-filtration). The [droplet spread](./transmission.md#summary-airborne-transmission), overall the most relevant spread of Covid, is prevented.

#### Mask Reuse and Cleaning
* wash with soap/hot water/machine-wash
* heat to around 70 degrees for 20 minutes e.g. hot water, steam or in the oven - all measures which have been scientifically proven to destroy the Sars-CoV-2 viruses and leave the mask intact [citation coming] [Chan et al.](#chan) have shown that Sars-CoV-1 is inactivated above 50 degrees.
* if washing or heating is not available (e.g. water saving in dry areas or camping), putting the mask to the bright sunlight is an alternative in areas with intense sunlight. 
* spray with pure alcohol (*no* alcohol intended for cleaning)
#### Mask Recommendation
Officially recommend masks for spread reduction in indoor rooms. Without an official recommendation, people can be put off or look afraid of masks, at least [were] in Europe, which is not desirable, since masks are protective. 
The recommendation should be strong for people feeling sick or with coughs in indoor public rooms.

<!--  
Reasons against masks seem sometimes rather searched:
* touching more often the face. 
> Infection is not possible by touching the skin alone, this is true for the skin in the face too. Touching into the mouth or the nose is something else, but for this, masks are protective. 
* Reserve for healthcare workers is needed for the big wave. 
> If masks help to prevent the big wave in its roots, then that's the better option.-->


### Ventilation
Ventilation reduces the indoor airborne spread, since the virion density in [outside air](#outside-is-safer) is much lower than in indoor air.

* [Escombe et al](#escombe) show natural ventilation is a valid measure and that in the first few minutes of opening the windows a major part of air is exchanged ([escombe: Figure 1](#https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040068.g001)).
* [Salathe et al](#salathe) simulate both the airborne (aerosol) and droplet spread of influenza, based on observed contact patters of high school students. They find that good ventilation is in their setting as effective as vaccinating around half of the population. 


### Distancing
[Airborne transmission](./transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission) - both droplets (reek of alcohol like spread) and aerosol/dry particulates (smoke-like) - can be reduced with distancing. Outside or with good ventilation, less distance is required. So if inside 2 meters is good, outside likely half a meter is enough. Wind direction should be considered outside. Inside, the airflow can have a direction too: e.g. the kitchen hood and the toilet venting draw air.


### Handling Covid-19 Cases and Quarantine
The focus should be on monitoring cases both for disease progression and to figure out and avoid infection paths. 
The thinking behind using a tactics of relaxed instructions is as follows:

#### Example Calculation of Spread
* ##### Strict Instructions
  With strict quarantine measures, infection risk from known infected  is more reduced but fewer people may do tests. Example: Out of 10 infected, 5 are known and 5 unknown/untested
  * the 5 known may infect on average 2 others (thus having a R value of 0.4)
  * the 5 untested may infect 10 others (having a R value of 2.0)
  
  Overall the 10 infected people infect 12 others and so an overall R value of 1.2.
  
* ##### Relaxed Instructions
  With relaxed instructions the known infected may on average infect more people but the number of unknown infected is smaller yielding an overall smaller spread. Example out of 10 infected 8 are known and 2 unknown:
  * the 8 known infect 4 others (R value of 0.5 for known infected)
  * the 2 unknown infect 4 others (R value of 2.0)
  
  Overall the 10 infected infect 8 others corresponding to an overall R value of 0.8

Overall in the above scenario the relaxed instruction yield an overall lower spread since more people do testing/are transparent about symptoms.


#### Suggestions for possibly Infected
* mask wearing in all public indoor spaces and best in all indoor rooms where susceptible people can be.
* no crowed indoor spaces
* distance: 1 meters outdoors and 2 meters indoors.
* no face-to-face talking without a mask
* regular ventilation
* avoid strains
* avoid activities with heavy breathing/deep inhaling e.g. sport and singing/shouting

#### Suggestions for Infected
as for [Possibly Infected](#suggestions-for-possibly-infected) and additionally
* [High-filtration mask](#high-filtration) in all indoor spaces/rooms where susceptible people can be. Including the own building (stairwell e.g. for laundry/going outside) and the flat e.g. when living in flat sharing. The mask should be changed frequently.
* no crowded places (outdoors and indoors)
* distance: 2 meters outdoors and 4 meters indoors.
* no close range face-to-face talking
* ventilate the room and flat before opening extern doors: Ideally ventilate before opening the personal room and open slightly only

#### Isolation/Home-Lockdown
To reduce spread isolation/home-lockdown is a radical measure. The more is known about Sars-CoV-2 and its spreading the more fine-grained the measures can be.
* isolation should be used with care since it can discourage people from testing and being transparent e.g. disclosing socials contacts and travel history.
* there are reasons against a complete stay at home order in my opinion as of 31.7.2020:
    - going outside is important for an intact immune system and good health. This is important for infected too.
    - indoor sports or movement can produce a lot of exhaled breadth condensate/aerosols and thus put people in the same building at 
    risk.

    Preventing spread opportunities e.g. both indoor and crowded public spaces is important however.

Isolation/stay-at-home may be working for people with own houses with gardens but for people living in big buildings, permanent home stay can increase transmission opportunities and no movement at all is often not healthy.

<!--
## Control Measures
[in work]

### Contact Tracing

### Mass Testing

### Outdoor Days
Avoiding foreign and public indoor rooms. So either at home or being outdoors. Prevents aerosol transmission. To prevent (the likely less relevant) droplet transmission, masks can be used for face to face talking outdoor. 

### Home Lock Down
A general curfew is not needed since outdoor days are enough to prevent transmission. Moreover a lot of aerosol is produced when doing indoor sports and put fellow occupants and neighbors at risk.

## Thoughts about Social Measures
**(in work and currently more brainstorming)**

This sections discusses measures that can be put in place if Covid-19 increase rapidly. For each measure 
* ###### Evidence
  epidemiological evidence: Have transmission events been observed in the setting? If there are transmission events can they be reliable detected?
* ###### ThinkThrough
  Thinking through/Common sense argumentation/Causal reasoning: Are there transmission opportunities? Are protection concepts? Are the concepts realistic in practice?
* ###### Experiences
  Experiences with measures in place. Are there experiences and if so what are they?
* ###### Narrowing
  Narrowing of Life. How individuals experience the measures? Are there costs associated e.g. school children missing education. Financial costs (state support assumed).
* ###### Comment
  The points above are summarized to a subjective rating/comment and a recommendation. The overall rating is subjective since it relies on  subjective weighting and subjective rating of the single points. 


### Reduction of Nightlife
A reduction of nightlife can reach from an early closure of clubs to a complete stay at home order at night. 
* Evidence: 
  * Many anecdote-like Covid-19 spreading events including super spreading events have been linked to nightlife [citations coming]. 
  * In many countries only few infections can be traced back to nightlife in comparison to transmissions in family settings and private parties. A possible explanation is that contact tracing and testing just works better in family settings. For a club with infected attendees, one week later every attendee should be tested, to my knowledge this is hardly done. In countries with low case numbers and extensive contact tracing, e.g. South Korea [and Japan, to check] many infections have been traced to clubs [citations in work].  
* ThinkThrough: Nightlife is about socializing. With loud music distancing is hardly doable. Drinking is common, which is a risk factor by itself, but it also prevents mask usage. 
* Experiences: 
  * An early closure of nightlife was implemented in (excat measures to be checked, combined with other measures/recommendations)
    * Greece  (11.8.20, closing between 24 pm and 7 am)
    * Denmark (15.9.20, closing at 22 pm in risk regions, recommendation to reduce social contact and ending private parties at 10 pm)
    * Spain (14.8.20, closing of nightclubs; bars and restaurants close at 1 am; no drinking on the streets)
  
    Two weeks after this measures the incidence of Covid cases flattened in all the above countries. 
    ##### Remark
    Denmark and Greece implemented this measures at low Covid incidences. Spain introduced additional measures later on. 
* Comment: In pandemic times a closure e.g. at 12 pm like implemented in Greece is reasonable; more strict depending on the situation e.g. risk of hospital overflow.  

> I recently (mid october 2020) read in the news, that people clubbing at 6 am in the morning had to go to quarantine because of a positive guest combined with a faulty guest list. 
> 
> Partying until 6 am and likely drinking a lot is not wanted, since protection measures are hardly followed and the immune system is burdened the next day repairing party-damage and may not fight viruses. This is double bad:
>   1. disease progression: longer asymptomatic phase and higher viral loads
>   2. feeling unwell the next day(s) is common and so possible Covid symptoms may be attributed to the party night and therefore not recognized.


### Reduce Alcohol Consumption
The history of prohibition dates back nearly as long as history itself has been handed down. However full prohibition never really worked. Today many countries have increased taxes. Often the taxes are not very high, just enough to reduce consumption but smuggling doesn't pay off. 
* ThinkThrough: 
  * Drinking a lot of alcohol diminishes the immune system. Alcohol concentration is higher in the pharynx while drinking and can prevent recognizing symptoms. 
  * Alcohol reduces the ability to concentrate and rashly action are more common, that's why no driving.  Permanent following of corona prevention measures needs concentration. 
* Comment: In restaurants non alcoholic drinks should be noticeable cheaper than alcoholic ones. 


### Corona Conform Schooling
Measure regarding schools can reach from complete closure to mild measures such as wearing face-masks in breaks.
* Evidence:  ~~In Israel the reopening of schools seems to have contributed to increased spread~~ **Correction**: There have been infection clusters in high schools (which have been probably caused by infected teachers, see [Summary Stein-Zamir](./spread_analyses.md#summary-stein-zamir)). But I could *not* find any evidence that the rise in cases after reopening the entire country (not only schools) can be causally linked to schools, neither in Israel nor in other countries. 
  > The early-on update ([Updates 16.10](./index.md#Updates)) was too early, I didn't read and lookup the sources carefully enough. 
* ThinkThrough:
  * Children are not main spreaders in the sense that there R value is low [Observations for Schools and Children](./spread_analyses.md#schools-and-children). If they spread then mainly with droplet transmission which can be prevented. 
  * However:
    * Even with a low R value children can contribute to the overall spread. 
    * Children easily forget about protection and masks. Especially if concentrating on other things e.g. preparing exams. 
    * Many people in the same room and school rooms may not be ventilated well
    * Many face-to-face talking situations with many different people
    * Children all come from different families and inside families protection is hardly doable. So person who want/need to protect cannot do so. 
* Experiences: 
  * Closing schools were part of lock-downs in spring 2020 in many countries, but the effect of school closures is unclear. What has been clearly observed however are negative impacts: on the learning experience, on the pupils and the parents/families. 
  * In some schools mask wearing is common, negative comments are few
  * Project based and individual learning are a common teaching approaches and known to work. 
* Comment: Children [spread Covid-19](./spread_analyses.md) less and produce less aerosol. So in areas which struggle with severe Covid situations, instead of complete closures, transmission can be efficiently reduced or even be prevented:
  * Masks when face-to-face talking e.g. in breaks
  * Fewer Exams, Projects can be graded
    * Exams can cause stress. With stress, coronaviruses get forgotten both by the immune system and oneself.  
    * With common cold like symptoms, one  usually doesn't skip an exam. In Covid times it is important to stay home. On the other hand, skipping an exam on purpose is also easy, some respiratory symptom will pop up. 
  * No talking exercises and more focus on written tasks. 
    * Showing educational movies. 
    * A good time to learn respectively teach programming and other computer skills. For computer skills there are many good self learning resources. 
  * More  individual than group work. If group work, then the groups should not change daily (weekly should be ok)
  * Outdoor sports
  * Relaxed presence requirements. E.g. students/pupils can be given tasks and the tasks can be done remotely. Projects can be rescheduled and started earlier. 
  * Library like settings/managed self-learning can be an alternative to closures: students just come to learn/work/read and somebody is there to help when needed (teacher - student protection measures may work better than student-student). Pupils/students can come to read, even if it's reading the favorite book.

<!--
### Guest Lists and Tracing
-->


## Risk Assessment

### Balancing of Measures
* Monitoring the personal/frequent customers of open(ed) businesses can be an indication for a new/increased Sars-CoV-2 spread. Representative samples twice per week should do the job.
* Step by Step adjusting helps to find a balance without many sudden/abrupt changes.
* All people belonging to a risk group for severe Covid-19 should be eligible to obtain free masks from pharmacies and doctors. The health care professionals should evaluate the model for a good fit and instruct the usage.
* Workers and patients of old-age homes, hospitals and similar institutions should monitor their health closely, watch for early Covid-19 signs and have easy access to Covid-19 PCR tests. Tests can also be used to do sampling to have an overview. Early action is important in these settings. Overall good life quality should be the goal. E.g. long-term prohibit visits is likely no solution.

### Outside is Safer
Outside the viruses get diluted and then are cleared/inactivated faster than inside. Due to decay and clearance there's no accumulation. However, outside infection probability is not zero just smaller than inside - as described in the [transmission section](./transmission.md), outside the main risk is in face-to-face situations. 

- [dilution](#dilution): The virion density decreases rapidly due to the air exchange that is present outdoors. 
- [virion destruction](#virion-decay): sunlight and heat  destroy virions or at least increases the decay.<!-- check humidity effect on virus survival-->
- [virion clearance](#virion-clearance): Humidity, rainfall and abundant attachment surfaces clear the air from virions.

#### Dilution
Outside there is much more air per person than inside:
* In an indoor room with 3 meters high and each person has a distance of 2 meters to the next, there are 12 cubic meters of air per person.
* In the most densely populated cities the population density reaches 100'000 person per square kilometer. Assuming that only the lower 150 meters of air are mixed, yields an average of (1'000'000 m^2 * 150 m) / 100'000 persons = 1500 cubic meters of air per person. <!--Compared to an indoor room with a high of 3 meters this corresponds to a distance of 22 meters to the next (if only aerosols transmission and not droplet transmission is taken into account). -->
* Large areas/entire world: Assuming a mixing of air in the lower 1500 density meters and an average population density of about 15 persons per square kilometer:<br> 
(1'000'000 * 1500 cubic meters)/15 persons  = 100 million cubic meters of air per person.

#### Virion Decay
Virion decay happens everywhere in the air, in the body, in water. Depending on the environment at different speed and with different mechanisms. The principal reasons for the virion decay are:
* the genome is [stored in unstable ssRNA](./coronavirus.md#ssrna)
* the envelope of coronaviruses consists of fatty acids which form the cell membranes of the virus host organism. In multicellular organism the cell membrane has not evolved to be stable outside the organism.
* virions have no repair mechanism since they don't have a metabolism

Process and situations virions decay occurs:
- ##### decay by sunlight
    mainly the UV part destroys RNA. Even stable DNA in the inner layer of the skin, protected by outer layer of the skin, a cell membrane and inside a the cell nucleus takes damage from exposure to UV (the more light absorbing melanin the less sunlight reaches the inner layer of the skin).
- ##### decay by heat 
    particles and surfaces exposed to sunlight reach easily temperatures over 45 degrees. At this temperature virions don't stay intact for long [Chan et al 2011](#chan).
- ##### disintegration
    * digestive enzymes from other organisms e.g. bacteria in water (sea, oceans, rivers) or in the alimentary disintegrate the envelope
    * soap destroys the lipid envelope and renders virions uninfectable
- ##### decay by time passing
    * single stranded RNA is unstable and thus even under optimal conditions virions have a probability to decay
    

#### Virion Clearance
Virion are cleared from the air by the mechanism below.  and due to [virion decay](#virion-decay) there's no accumulation.
- [virion decay](#virion-decay) in air: occurs mainly through sun light
- condensation 
- washed out by rain
- virion attachment to non infectable materials (which is nearly everything except a tiny fraction of cells in the scarce hosts) 
    * earth
    * water
    * rocks

## Monitor 

### Monitor Evolution
[in work]
From time to time full genome samples should be analyzed to monitor evolution of Sars-CoV-2 and to deduce the international spread. 

### Monitor Prevalence
To adjust the measures and to communicate these it is important to estimate and monitor different incidence rates.

#### Different Counts
There are several counts to distinguish [not very clear on this page yet, in work]:
* Number of people getting currently infected. This number predicts how many people may need hospital treatment in 2 - 5 weeks. This number can only be estimated. The numbers depends on the protection measures and the count of currently infected (mostly those not knowing)
* Number of people with viruses detectable with PCR/Antigen tests. They may not yet be symptomatic but may get tested through sampling or contact tracing. They may or may not develop symptoms, about 80% develop symptoms. 
* Number of people with symptoms. Likely these are most often detected in case counts. Symptoms usually come 1 - 10 days after the infection occurred.
* Number of people admitted to hospitals. 
* End of disease. Often about 10 days after initial symptoms for mild disease. The disease end can be later or be fatal in about 1 in 400 cases. 
#### Motivation
* Since what control tactics is optimal and/or needed depends largely on incidence rates. If the incidence rate is out of some bounds the strategy may fail to work or be unnecessary strict: 
  * Controlling methods relying on a working contact tracing need low incidence rates and detecting most cases with monitoring. To rely on contact tracing detection rate should be at least 75%. Still useful if lower but one shouldn't rely on it.   
  * Many controlling methods rely on methods reducing the infection probability but not preventing it (e.g. distancing, low-filter face masks), that only works if there are not to many infected 
  * Shutting down businesses (badly ventilated offices and fabrics are the fare bigger risk than schools or outdoor gastronomy) may not be adequate at an incidence rate of 0.1% of currently infected, adequate to close targeted at 1% and as much as possible all indoor settings at 10%. 
* Planning of in hospitals: Knowing the current incidence rates gives an estimate for the capacity needed in a few weeks
* Communication: Knowing the cases helps on decision for everybody such if to avoid crowded spaces or staying home when having respiratory symptoms 

#### Detect Monitor Failure
The equation 
`current_death_count = infections_20_days_ago * fatality_rate` 
can be used to detect if the estimation methods worked in the past. Assuming a fatality rate of 0.25% yields one in 400 dies from Covid-19. So the 
`estimated_past_case_count = 400 * current_death_count` 
The case can be different yielding a correction factor:
`correction_factor = estimated_past_case_count/past_case_count_from_death_count`
If the testing strategies didn't change the current actual infected can be estimated with the correction_factor: 
`actual_current_case_count = current_case_count * correction_factor`.


#### On Monitor and Control Failure
A correction factor greater than 2 needs redesign of the case estimates. A correction factor larger than 5 combined with a death count greater than 2.5 per million per day I consider worrying (Sections [Strategy](#strategy) and [On Numbers](#on-numbers)). How much worrying depends if, how effective and when measures have been adapted. 
Transmissions should be reduced or even prevented until a clear view is available. In serious situations (possible hospital overflow), a tactics uniform across movement areas and between them movement monitoring/controls/reduction can be necessary.

* Pausing infections especially everything super-spreading opportunities i.e. indoor rooms. 
  * closure of non essential businesses
  * for somewhat essential businesses e.g. longer distance public transport: names can be recorded and people need to hand in some argumentation in the next weeks why it was essential to enter. This causes few immediate work/tumults but likely discourages most from unnecessarily entering. 
  * whitelist approach if doable e.g. negative test/no fever required
  * pause of non essential visits to hospitals and so on
* sample and estimate the numbers
  * should be doable within a few days
  * 5'000 tests per million inhabitants should work to estimate to infection rate with an accuracy of .5% (Uniform -random- sampling) 
* choosing tactics suiting the strategy given the situation
 

#### What to Monitor
1. How many of the people, which have respiratory diseases have Covid-19. In many areas likely the most common respiratory disease is Covid-19 and so one should stay home with any respiratory symptoms. 
    > Personal guess, 16.10.20: In many regions of Europe, the most common respiratory disease likely is Covid-19. Moreover the steep increases in cases despite protection measures in place including strict quarantine of known infected, indicate that across Europe the majority of cases are undetected and carry the transmissions. ([Example Calculation of Spread](#example-calculation-of-spread) in the section [Handling Covid-19 Cases and Quarantine](#handling-covid-19-cases-and-quarantine))
2. The incidence of Covid-19 in different population groups (e.g. hospital workers, young people: students and school children)
3. Other respiratory diseases: influenza and common colds should be monitored too:
  * knowing what is around makes diagnosis easier, especially if it turns out there is 'only' Covid-19
  * long term adverse effects of common colds are likely underestimated. This is a good opportunity to diminish there prevalence and reduce the number of strains circulating. 

#### How to Monitor
* **Frequency:** Ideally these are taken near daily, else at least weekly. 
* **Communicate:** Often, as of 16.10.20 only the positive tests and the positive test rate are communicated. However these numbers are hard to interpret: e.g. many of the tested often are health care professionals (who know how to protect and incidence is thus underestimated), how many of the tested are healthy and just need some clean sheet to travel, how many who are tested have symptoms, how many are tested because of company monitoring. 
* **Methods:** 
  see also [testing schemes](#testing-schemes)
  * **very low to low incidence:** case counts 
  * **low to mid incidence:** case counts people turn up for testing can be used. The contact tracing yields then additional cases which can be used to scale counts from those who asked for tests. 
  * **mid to high incidence:** sampling

### Testing Schemes
Testing some for low and high incidence. Reasons are noted or already mentioned in the section [What to Monitor](#what-to-monitor).
#### Testing Priorities at High Incidence 
1. Testing of risk patients. Reason: Appropriate treatment.  
2. Health care workers and other groups with contact to risk groups. Reason: Shield risk groups. 
3. How many people with respiratory disease symptoms have Covid-19. 
4. Tests to do contact tracing. Reason: Break infection chains
5. Sampling different population groups e.g. young people: students and school children, region based, incoming travelers. Reason: Have an overview what's going on to adapt measures. 
6. Monitoring respiratory diseases: influenza and common colds. 
7. Tests for travel permissions, quarantine cancel and so on.
    
#### Testing Priorities at Low Incidence 
1. Testing of risk patients. Reason: An appropriate treatment from early on.
2. Health care workers and other groups with contact to risk groups
3. Tests to do contact tracing and quarantine cancel
4. Tests to estimate the overall incidence (travel test below can give an indication). Reason: When the incidence is high, a different tactics for controlling can be appropriate.
5. Tests for travel permissions and so on. 


## On Numbers
[in work]
Assumptions: 
* fatality rate of .25% i.e. 1 in 400 (The [death rate](./covid19.md#fatality-rate) depends on many factors and varies considerably); 
* average disease duration 10 days; 
 
Notations and Equivalences:
* all counts are day counts unless noted otherwise
* case count per million inhabitants per day = 400 * death count per million inhabitants per day (assuming 1 death in 400)
* total current infected per million = 10 * case count per million per day (assuming 10 day infection duration)
* K = 1000 e.g. 10 K = 10'000

### Numbers and Comments
[in work and to be checked]
* The **numbers can vary greatly** across regions and hospitals capacities, population structure and how the infection are distributed across the population. 
* The **[fatality rate](./covid19.md#fatality-rate) depends on many factors and varies considerably** for different regions and population groups. Extends the [strategy section](#strategy). 
* The case counts are the **actual** infected and not only the positive tested. 
* The case counts/incidence can be higher for young people without directly affecting the death counts/hospital beds, so the case counts/incidences are averages for the population groups with the **possibility for severe Covid**. 
[in work]
* the numbers should be **lower during cold seasons**, since aerosol transmission is very hard to control. Some immune protection can be built up in warm seasons but not in cold season. 
* The current numbers need to be estimated. The death count detects infections happened about 20 days in the past. The counts from contact tracing or testing symptomatic are a few days in the past. 
  
total current infected in percent  | total current infected per million | case count per million inhabitants per day | death count per million inhabitants per day | comment if the estimated values are for several days greater and *no* adequate measures in place
--------|--------|------|--------|---
<0.2%   |2 K     | 200  |    ~.5 | if less/not increasing/mainly young infected: loose rules, own responsibility
>0.4%   |4 K     | 400  |    ~1  | if greater/or increasing: **monitoring** needed. Prefer outdoor to indoor
>1 %    |10 K    | 1000 |  ~2.5  | worrisome if case count increases => tighten the rules, infection risk is increased due to many infected. 
>4 %    |40 K    | 4000 |  ~10   | roughly the maximum death count reached in Sweden and France in Spring 2020, death count reached in autumn (15.10 - 31.10.) in heavy hit regions of Switzerland (VS, SZ)
> 5%    |50 K    | 5000 | ~12.5  | **prevent**, infection very risk high for everybody, temporary hospitals may be needed 
> 10%   |100 K   |10'000| ~25+   | prevent even at very high costs, **hospitals can get overwhelmed**, reached in regions caught on the wrong foot
>  15%  |150_K   |15'000| ~50++  | hospitals completely overwhelmed and chaotic therefore death rate doubles or more, reached in heaviest hit regions. 

## Data 
Data production/collection, data description and data analysis can be done separate today. Remark: Separation of roles has a long tradition in science: Tycho Brahe collected the planetary motions, Kepler described them and Newton explained them. 

Today separation of roles can be done faster, easier and in cooperation, thanks to modern communication technologies. The basis is, that data is observed/produced, recorded (often free of costs nowadays), annotated and searchable published.


### Distributed Handling
In computer science it is well known that distributed and parallel data handling works best. This even on computers with only a couple of cores.
* Map reduce and similar
* Programming paradigms enabling parallel execution data handling

We humans have billions of brains, so with good communication we've got a lot of brain power to tackle any task. 

<!--
* there are many skilled data scientists around the world. Many spending their time presenting us the most relevant ads. Relevant usually means highest click rate i.e. most distracting. Whether the distraction is good or bad depends on pre and post activity, e.g. to analyze Covid data for a change can be welcome. Remark: I consider adds as useful for product information and spread. -->

#### Data Specifications
For data analysis it is important to have accurate, consistent and clearly specified data and notifications if the data may not be accurate or the specifications changed. Notified corrections are helpful too.  
The different data measurement methods related to Covid-19, combined with no or few specifications, have a lot of space for improvement all around the world and a worldwide agreement on annotations and publishing of country/region specific specifications would make the data at least partially comparable. 

<!--todo:update -->
E.g. In Switzerland as of 17.4.20, the testing policy is to test only people who are sick _and_ belong to a risk group. The policy is mostly followed, however is hard to find on the official page from the BAG (Swiss Health Department, bag.admin.ch in the German Covid-19 FAQ) and even left out on the English version (as of 17.4.20). The official statistics on the same domain, has no note about this testing scheme. The data are analyzable (since largely consistent) and expressive but just not comparable to countries, where everybody who is sick or even everybody who could be infected is tested.
Remark: As of 1.5.20 more people are allowed to test. 

> Subjective Remark, May 2020: While not perfect, the government and the BAG in Switzerland do overall a good job. What I consider done right: A slow down of life to have people focus on the important things among those health. A temporary slow down of spread to buy some time for preparation, experience gain and research. Personally, I liked (and helped me doing this page) that there was no stay at home order. Allowing people and especially children to go outside is important. The longer Covid-19 spread patterns can be analyzed the more fine-grained measures can be. A gradual reopening starting in April makes sense. 
Room for improvement: Masks benefits indoors and that outdoors infection risk is fare smaller should be clearly stated.<br>
> To rate afterthought is much easier than to be there in charge with few proven and sure knowledge. In that view for all countries, there were difficult decisions and no clear right or wrong. Most countries found their path according to their situation. But I think now it is time to ease lock-downs step by step, especially in areas where there are not many severe Covid-19 cases. Around the world it remains important, however, to support public health. Keeping some slow down can be part of that. In case of new findings and knowledge, **adaption of strategies** is important. 
Right or Wrong and Perfection anyways are often a matter of viewpoint and angle. 

#### Data Features
* For analysis is useful to have as complete, exact and accurate data as possible and data protection laws permit e.g. age, medical conditions and locations.
* Clinical observations well annotated and as complete as possible. 
* Interpretation and analysis are nice to have but not necessary. 

#### Easy Readable
Data ideally are in a common format (e.g. CSV), on a public API (e.g. GitHub repository or REST API) and are annotated e.g. contain a readme with the specifications what and how is measured.
