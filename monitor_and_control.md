## Protection Measures
The following relies on the assumption that the main transmission of Sars-CoV-2 is [airborne](./transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission) (either droplet, aerosol or dry form transmission). This is not yet confirmed. Evidence for dry form transmission is described in [Proposal of a Dry Form Transmission Model](./transmission.md). Airborne transmissions can be thought [smoke like](./transmission.md#metaphor-and-measures) or like the reek of alcohol in the case of close range droplet transmission. For the first non-smokers protections measures are suitable and for the latter distancing is enough.

### Support Immune Protection
Completely avoiding Sars-CoV-2 can be as hard as avoiding dust and smoke. This is hard. Even in laboratory settings virus protection is difficult [[Wurtz, Raoult et al](#raoult), [Artika and Ma'roef](#artika)] and  Sars-CoV-1/2 protection is especially difficult. There have been several cases of infections in labs with Sars-CoV-1 [Orellana et al](#orellana), [Lim et al](#lim) and recommendations for autopsies of Covid-19 fatalities are very strict [Finegan et al](#finegan). Out of labs, once a coronavirus is widespread, complete avoidance is nearly impossible. Sars-Cov-2 is widespread. The best protection available is a good immune system. Vaccines - if once available - just prepare the immune system and do not replace it. So the long-term focus should be to support the overall health of humanity. In tropical regions where Sars-CoV-2 infects less virulent but there are many more infectious diseases, this should be the main focus. 
[in work]
Proposals for good health:
* providing settings that support good health
    - allow people outside to move
    - environmental protection including clean air
* lessen stress 
    - secure and affordable life including basic health care
    - less pressure overall
* healthy nutrition 
* providing information and tips to focus on health and the immune system

Covid is just one of many reasons good health - including an intact immune system - is important.


### Masks
Mask reduce spread since they mitigate both the infection and spread risk. 

#### Mask Effectiveness
* [Milton et al.](#milton2013) measured the influenza viruses spread from patients with and without wearing a surgical mask. They found:
    - Particles greater than 5 micro meter: Surgical masks nearly eliminated viral RNA detection in the coarse aerosol fraction: resulting in a 25 fold reduction in the number of viral copies 
    - Particles smaller than 5 micro meter:  statistically significant 2.8 fold reduction in viral copies detected in the fine aerosol fraction.
    - Overall: Surgical masks significantly reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold.
    
    > Assuming a reduction of exhaled aerosols by a factor of 2.5 (60% reduction) and a reduction by a factor 2 (50% reduction) for inhaling: everybody wearing a mask yields a total reduction factor of 5 = (2 times fewer particles inhaled) * (2.5 times fewer particles in the air since fewer exhaled) for aerosol transmission. This can yield a significant reduction of transmission in public indoor rooms (e.g. Supermarkets or Public Transport). <!--This would be a greater reduction in the reproduction factor than  observed for other measures. A factor 5 reduction would be enough to reduce the reproduction factor below 1 if an initial value of 4 is estimated (an estimate from the imperial college in London by Ferguson, Bhatt et al](#ferguson-bhatt).[in work]-->

#### Mask Types
Common types of masks are:
* _Surgical masks_ are constructed for comfort and inside-out protection and not outside-in protection. 
* _Protection masks against dust_ are constructed for outside-in protection and therefore good for self protection.
* _Textile masks_ are available in a lot of sizes and styles. They may not offer the best protection in theory but they may offer the best fit and be worn most often due to comfort and style. 

#### Mask use Cases
* For self protection good fit and a good outside-to-inside filter are important. 
* In dry air, water [droplets shrink](./transmission.md#dry-form-transmission-model), thus fine grained filters are especially important for self protection. 
* To avoid person to person droplet transmission e.g. when speaking, consequent wearing in close distance face-to-face situations is necessary. 

#### Mask Reuse and Cleaning
* wash with a lot of soap/machine-wash
* heat to around 70 degrees for 20 minutes e.g. hot water, steam or in the oven - all measures which have been scientifically proven to destroy the Sars-CoV-2 viruses and leave the mask intact [citation coming] [Chan et al.](#chan) have shown that Sars-CoV-1 is inactivated above 50 degrees.
* if washing or heating is not available (e.g. water saving in dry areas or camping), putting the mask to the bright sunlight is an alternative in areas with intense sunlight. 

#### Mask Recommendation
Officially recommend masks for spread reduction in indoor rooms. Without an official recommendation, people can be put off or look afraid of masks, at least [were] in Europe, which is not desirable, since masks are protective. 
The recommendation should be strong for people feeling sick or with coughs in indoor public rooms.

<!--  
Reasons against masks seem sometimes rather searched:
* touching more often the face. 
> Infection is not possible by touching the skin alone, this is true for the skin in the face too. Touching into the mouth or the nose is something else, but for this, masks are protective. 
* Reserve for healthcare workers is needed for the big wave. 
> If masks help to prevent the big wave in its roots, then that's the better option.-->


### Ventilation
Ventilation reduces the indoor airborne spread, since the virion density in [outside air](#outside-is-safer) is much lower than in indoor air.

* [Escombe et al](#escombe) show natural ventilation is a valid measure and that in the first few minutes of opening the windows a major part of air is exchanged ([escombe: Figure 1](#https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040068.g001)).
* [Salathe et al](#salathe) simulate both the airborne (aerosol) and droplet spread of influenza, based on observed contact patters of high school students. They find that good ventilation is in their setting as effective as vaccinating around half of the population. 


### Distancing
[Airborne transmission](./transmission.md#recap-airborne-transmission) - both droplets (reek of alcohol like spread) and aerosol/dry particulates (smoke-like) - can be reduced with distancing. Outside or with good ventilation, less distance is required. So if inside 2 meters is good, outside likely half a meter is enough. Wind direction should be considered outside. Inside, the airflow can have a direction too: e.g. the kitchen hood and the toilet venting draw air.


### Handling Covid-19 Cases and Quarantine
The focus should be on monitoring cases both for disease progression and to figure out and avoid infection paths. 

The thinking behind using a tactics of relaxed instructions is as follows:

* ##### Strict Instructions
  With strict quarantine measures, infection risk from known infected  is more reduced but fewer people may do tests. Example: Out of 10 infected, 5 are known and 5 unknown/untested
  * the 5 known may infect on average 2 others (thus having a R value of 0.4)
  * the 5 untested may infect 10 others (having a R value of 2.0)
  
  Overall the 10 infected people infect 12 others and so an overall R value of 1.2.
* ##### Relaxed Instructions
  With relaxed instructions the known infected may on average infect more people but the number of unknown infected is smaller yielding an overall smaller spread. Example out of 10 infected 8 are known and 2 unknown:
  * the 8 known infect 4 others (R value of 0.5 for known infected)
  * the 2 unknown infect 4 others (R value of 2.0)
  Overall the 10 infected infect 8 others corresponding to an overall R value of 0.8

Overall in the above scenario the relaxed instruction yield an overall lower spread since more people do testing/are transparent about symptoms.


#### Suggestions for possibly Infected
* mask wearing in all public indoor spaces and best in all indoor rooms.
* no crowed indoor spaces
* distance: 1 meters outdoors and 2 meters indoors.
* no face-to-face talking without a mask
* regular ventilation
* avoid strains
* avoid activities with heavy breathing/deep inhaling e.g. sport and singing/shouting

#### Suggestions for Infected
as for [Possibly Infected](#suggestions-for-possibly-infected) and additionally
* permanent mask wearing in all indoor spaces/rooms where susceptible people can be. Including the own building (stairwell) and the flat e.g. when living in flat sharing.  
* no crowded places (outdoors and indoors)
* distance: 2 meters outdoors and 4 meters indoors.
* no close range face-to-face talking
* ventilate the room and flat before opening extern doors: Ideally ventilate before opening the personal room and open slightly only

#### Isolation/Home-Lockdown
To reduce spread isolation/home-lockdown is a radical measure. The more is known about Sars-CoV-2 and its spreading the more fine-grained the measures can be.
* isolation should be used with care since it can discourage people from testing and being transparent e.g. disclosing socials contacts and travel history.
* there are reasons against a complete stay at home order in my opinion as of 31.7.2020:
    - going outside is important for an intact immune system and good health. This is important for infected too.
    - indoor sports or movement can produce a lot of exhaled breadth condensate/aerosols and thus put people in the same building at 
    risk.

    Avoiding spread opportunities e.g. both indoor and crowded public spaces is important however.

Isolation/stay-at-home may be working for people with own houses with gardens but for people living in big buildings, permanent home stay can increase transmission opportunities and no movement at all is often not healthy.

## Risk Assessment

### Balancing of Measures
* Monitoring the personal/frequent customers of open(ed) businesses can be an indication for a new/increased Sars-CoV-2 spread. Representative samples twice per week should do the job.
* Step by Step adjusting helps to find a balance without sudden abrupt changes.
* All people belonging to a risk group for severe Covid-19 should be eligible to obtain free masks from pharmacies and doctors. The health care professionals should evaluate the model for a good fit and instruct the usage.
* Workers and patients of old-age homes, hospitals and similar institutions should monitor their health closely, watch for early Covid-19 signs and have easy access to Covid-19 PCR tests. Tests can also be used to do sampling to have an overview. Early action is important in these settings. Overall good life quality should be the goal. E.g. long-term prohibit visits is likely no solution.

### Outside is Safer
Outside the viruses get diluted and then are cleared/inactivated faster than inside. Due to decay and clearance there's no accumulation. However, outside infection probability is not zero just smaller than inside - as described in the [transmission section](./transmission.md), outside the main risk is in face-to-face situations. 

- [dilution](#dilution): The virion density decreases rapidly due to the air exchange that is present outdoors. 
- [virion destruction](#virion-decay): sunlight and heat  destroy virions or at least increases the decay.<!-- check humidity effect on virus survival-->
- [virion clearance](#virion-clearance): Humidity, rainfall and abundant attachment surfaces clear the air from virions.

#### Dilution
Outside there is much more air per person than inside:
* In an indoor room with 3 meters high and each person has a distance of 2 meters to the next, there are 12 cubic meters of air per person.
* In the most densely populated cities the population density reaches 100'000 person per square kilometer. Assuming that only the lower 150 meters of air are mixed, yields an average of (1'000'000 m^2 * 150 m) / 100'000 persons = 1500 cubic meters of air per person. <!--Compared to an indoor room with a high of 3 meters this corresponds to a distance of 22 meters to the next (if only aerosols transmission and not droplet transmission is taken into account). -->
* Large areas/entire world: Assuming a mixing of air in the lower 1500 density meters and an average population density of about 15 persons per square kilometer:<br> 
(1'000'000 * 1500 cubic meters)/15 persons  = 100 million cubic meters of air per person.

#### Virion Decay
Virion decay happens everywhere in the air, in the body, in water. Depending on the environment at different speed and with different mechanisms. The principal reasons for the virion decay are:
* the genome is [stored in unstable ssRNA](./coronavirus.md#ssRNA)
* the envelope of coronaviruses consists of fatty acids which form the cell membranes of the virus host organism. In multicellular organism the cell membrane has not evolved to be stable outside the organism.
* virions have no repair mechanism since they don't have a metabolism

Process and situations virions decay occurs:
- sunlight inactivates virions<br>
    mainly the UV part destroys RNA. Even stable DNA in the inner layer of the skin, protected by outer layer of the skin, a cell membrane and inside a the cell nucleus takes damage from exposure to UV (the more light absorbing melanin the less sunlight reaches the inner layer of the skin).
- heat<br>
    particles and surfaces exposed to sunlight reach easily temperatures over 45 degrees. At this temperature virions don't stay intact for long [Chan et al 2011](#chan).
- disintegration<br>
    * digestive enzymes from other organisms e.g. bacteria in water (sea, oceans, rivers) or in the alimentary disintegrate the envelope
    * soap destroys the lipid envelope and renders virions uninfectable
- decay<br>
    * single stranded RNA is unstable and thus even under optimal conditions virions have a probability to decay
    

#### Virion Clearance
Virion are cleared from the air by the mechanism below.  and due to [virion decay](#virion-decay) there's no accumulation.
- [virion decay](#virion-decay) in air: occurs mainly through sun light
- condensation 
- washed out by rain
- virion attachment to non infectable materials (which is nearly everything except a tiny fraction of cells in the scarce hosts) 
    * earth
    * water
    * rocks

## Monitor 

### Monitor Evolution
[in work]
From time to time full genome samples should be analyzed to monitor evolution of Sars-CoV-2 and to deduce the international spread. 


## Data 
Data production/collection, data description and data analysis can be done separate today. Remark: Separation of roles has a long tradition in science: Tycho Brahe collected the planetary motions, Kepler described them and Newton explained them. 

Today separation of roles can be done faster, easier and in cooperation, thanks to modern communication technologies. The basis is, that data is observed/produced, recorded (often free of costs nowadays), annotated and searchable published.


### Distributed Handling
In computer science it is well known that distributed and parallel data handling works best. This even on computers with only a couple of cores.
* Map reduce and similar
* Programming paradigms enabling parallel execution data handling

We humans have billions of brains, so with good communication we've got a lot of brain power to tackle any task. 

<!--
* there are many skilled data scientists around the world. Many spending their time presenting us the most relevant ads. Relevant usually means highest click rate i.e. most distracting. Whether the distraction is good or bad depends on pre and post activity, e.g. to analyze Covid data for a change can be welcome. Remark: I consider adds as useful for product information and spread. -->

#### Data Specifications
For data analysis it is important to have accurate, consistent and clearly specified data and notifications if the data may not be accurate or the specifications changed. Notified corrections are helpful too.  
The different data measurement methods related to Covid-19, combined with no or few specifications, have a lot of space for improvement all around the world and a worldwide agreement on annotations and publishing of country/region specific specifications would make the data at least partially comparable. 

<!--todo:update -->
E.g. In Switzerland as of 17.4.20, the testing policy is to test only people who are sick _and_ belong to a risk group. The policy is mostly followed, however is hard to find on the official page from the BAG (Swiss Health Department, bag.admin.ch in the German Covid-19 FAQ) and even left out on the English version (as of 17.4.20). The official statistics on the same domain, has no note about this testing scheme. The data are analyzable (since largely consistent) and expressive but just not comparable to countries, where everybody who is sick or even everybody who could be infected is tested.
Remark: As of 1.5.20 more people are allowed to test. 

> Subjective Remark, May 2020: While not perfect, the government and the BAG in Switzerland do overall a good job. What I consider done right: A slow down of life to have people focus on the important things among those health. A temporary slow down of spread to buy some time for preparation, experience gain and research. Personally, I liked (and helped me doing this page) that there was no stay at home order. Allowing people and especially children to go outside is important. The longer Covid-19 spread patterns can be analyzed the more fine-grained measures can be. A gradual reopening starting in April makes sense. 
Room for improvement: Masks benefits indoors and that outdoors infection risk is fare smaller should be clearly stated.<br>
> To rate afterthought is much easier than to be there in charge with few proven and sure knowledge. In that view for all countries, there were difficult decisions and no clear right or wrong. Most countries found their path according to their situation. But I think now it is time to ease lock-downs step by step, especially in areas where there are not many severe Covid-19 cases. Around the world it remains important, however, to support public health. Keeping some slow down can be part of that. In case of new findings and knowledge, **adaption of strategies** is important. 
Right or Wrong and Perfection anyways are often a matter of viewpoint and angle. 

#### Data Features
* For analysis is useful to have as complete, exact and accurate data as possible and data protection laws permit e.g. age, medical conditions and locations.
* Clinical observations well annotated and as complete as possible. 
* Interpretation and analysis are nice to have but not necessary. 

#### Easy Readable
Data ideally are in a common format (e.g. CSV), on a public API (e.g. GitHub repository or REST API) and are annotated e.g. contain a readme with the specifications what and how is measured.
