The PExA device consists of an optical particle counter that can measure number and size of exhaled particles (PEx) with an impactor where the particles are sampled on a membrane for subsequent biochemical analysis. PEx are thought to originate from the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) that covers the epithelial wall of the airways [4–8]. In awake patients, here described as normal breathing, a special breathing manoeuvre is used, to reinforce airway closure and re-opening [9]. Previously it has been shown that a change in the composition of the RTLF reflects different airway diseases [1, 2, 10–13].
