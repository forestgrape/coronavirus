# Spread Patterns
The spread pattern observed for Covid-19 and other diseases are discussed. The goal is to understand the spread of Covid-19 to be able to find the optimal measures.

**Crowding and the shape of COVID-19 epidemics**

#### Goal
Figure out the effect of population densities (crowding), mobility, humidity on the overall and the temporal distribution of Covid-19 incidences. 

#### Methods
[in work]

#### Analysis Results
* lower density = sparse (rural areas): 
  * more peaked incidence rates, most of the infections are within 20 days (Figure 1a)
  * lower cumulative incidence (final attack rate)
* high density = crowded (large cities): 
  * less peaked incidence rates, most of the cases are within 40 days (Figure 1a)
  * higher cumulative incidence rates

#### Simulation Results
* lower density = sparse: 
  * intervention measures cause the incidence curve to flatten out and moderately reduce total case count (Figure 3 c and d)
* high density = crowded: 
  * intervention measures are crucial since without interventions prolonged spread with high numbers of infected are expected (Figure 3 c and d)
