# Thoughts on Competition Advantages and Transmissibility
> explorative chapter

## Summary
Since early in the SARS-2 pandemics new variants are observed. Sometimes a competitive advantage against existing variants is observed, from which a higher transmissibility then is inferred. In the following it is argued that a competitive advantage is not necessarily the result of a higher transmissibility but can also result from immune evasion (even at quite low seroprevalence) or from strains spreading faster (not necessarily more efficient).
* *Hypothesis 1: Immune Evasion even at low Seroprevalence yields a Competition Advantage*: The Covid spread is highly uneven, in the sense that some individuals have many secondary cases while most individuals have no secondary cases, this motivates to define individual R values. The distribution of the individual R values is uneven: While many individuals having low R values, a few have very high R values. If a Covid variant can now reinfect people with high R values, it has a competition advantage over the other variants.
* *Hypothesis 2: Faster Infection yields a Competition Advantage*: Some variants infect faster which makes their waves peakier. Such variants have competitions advantages over slower variants even without a higher transmissibility. The fast variants rush through the most susceptible hosts and leave only few hosts for slow variants. This because those recently infected, have an alert and well prepared immune system generally to respiratory viruses infections and closely related strains where cross immunity is strong especially.
* *Epidemiological Evidences:* The hypotheses above explain patterns observed for the spread of new variants: fast strains such as B.1.1.7 are observed to spread especially when Covid-spread-favorable situation are there (e.g. release of measures or spread-friendly climate situations) and immune evasion variants are often observed when there's preexisting immunity.
* *Biological Explanations:* The effects of mutations on immune evasion and faster infections are discussed. Point mutations often yield neutralising antibody escape targeting the receptor binding domain or mutations can increase the priming through proteases which yields a shorter virion time which results in faster infections.

## Introduction
Coronaviruses are well known for the ability to cross species borders and adapt to new situations:
* SARS-CoV-2 jumped from humans to a variety of domestic animals.
* Bovine coronaviruses spread from cattle to many ungulates both domestic and wild.
* In cell cultures coronavirus can adapt within a couple of generations. E.g. 
  * they can adapt such that the virions tolerate high temperature (55 degrees) better [Laude](../2_biological/virion_viability.md#summary-laude).

Regarding SARS-CoV-2, new lineages emerged with a competition advantage. The underlying mechanisms for the competition advantages are often unclear however. Some times higher overall R values are concluded from a competition advantage. The goal of this chapter is to outline that a competition advantage can have several causes:
* higher transmissibility in the sense of an overall higher R value
* faster spread and thus outpacing lineages spreading at the same time
* immune escape which enables reinfection. Since the individual R value distribution is skewed this can yield a higher spread.



## Hypothesis 1: Immune Escape can result in a Significant Competition Advantage even at low Seroprevalence

### Model: The Overall R value of a Variant is the Average of the R Values of the Individuals Susceptible to a Variant
The Covid spread is uneven: with a few yielding many secondary cases while many don't transmit Covid well. The uneven spread motivates to define individual R values. The overall R value of a SARS-CoV-2 variant then calculates as averaging the individual R values of the persons susceptible to transmit the variant in question. If a variant is able to reinfect those with high R values, its has a competitive advantage over other variants and its observed R value is much higher than for variant which need to spread through population groups with low R values.

Remark: The immune escape does not necessarily be an escape from neutralizing antibodies but can also result from other immune evasion mechanisms such as from T cell or non-neutralizing antibody epitopes. 

### Skewed Spreader Distribution
Epidemiological and experimental observations show that: 
* Few people infect many others while most infected have no secondary cases.
* Some people exhale much more aerosol than others.
* People with live in dense living conditions are much more likely to get infected and to spread Covid.


## Hypothesis 2: Faster Infections Cycle can yield a Competition Advantage
Coronaviruses can evolve to infect faster i.e. once infected a high viral loads builds up faster  (=faster growth as a virus entity). The faster infection yields competition advantage when two strains compete for hosts to infects. The faster variant wins even if it is not more transmissible since a follow up infection is unlikely due to cross-immunity and alertness of the respiratory tract immune system.


### Spread Advantages by faster Infections
1. *Advantages in Direct Competition*
   * Super spreading situations contribute to the spread of Covid. If in a single super spreading situation a fast and a slow strain super-spread, the fast strain will out-compete the slow variant. 
   * Situations supporting high spreading are not equally distributed, in the sense they often occur clustered e.g. in times when protection measures are changed. Similar to a single super-spreading event, during short periods of high spread, the faster spreading variant will conquer more ground than a slow spreading variant.
2. *Advantages in Circumventing Precaution Measures*
   * Often some time is needed to acknowledge feeling unwell. A fast strain is more likely to spread ahead of precaution steps: Avoiding crowded indoor space is important to reduce the spread. 
   * Contact tracing needs some time, which may work less well if the variant infects really fast.
3. *Advantages in Competent Immune Systems*
  Slow infecting coronaviruses such as SARS-1 and MERS take long to built up a high viral load: 
  * which is mostly possible when the immune system is (temporary) reduced
  * the patients at the time of peak infectiousness are usually symptomatic and often very sick. 
  
  All strains of SARS-2 are already faster than SARS-1 and MERS, however there are variations among the SARS-2 strains. Even for people with a good immune system, a fast infecting variant may transmit before immune protections are in place. So when a strain is able to infect fast, an increased spread through immune-competent people is thinkable. Which could mean that the spread becomes more evenly distributed.  

> 2. and 3. can yield effectively higher transmissibility and increase the average R value compared to previous variants. The effects of 2. can be reduced by information. The effects of 3. by pr testing of contacts from risk groups.


### Biological Mechanism for faster Growth
One way coronaviruses can evolve to infect faster, is to have the spikes primed faster. Spike priming is increased by cleavage sites better optimised to existing cleavage proteases or that the cleavage sites can be cleaved by more proteases. A faster spike priming induces a shorter virion phase and a faster cell cell fusion. The shortened virion phase yields faster infection cycles and possibly a faster increase in viral load.

> The final viral load is not necessarily higher since a faster spike priming usually causes an infection to be more localised which is easier for the immune system to recognise and to eliminate.

> A broader spike activation can increase the tropism of coronaviruses. An increased tropism can cause different disease patterns which can be more serious.


## Evidence for Competition Advantages without Increased Transmissibility

> **in work and to be checked**

### Observations indicating No Overall Increased Transmissibility
Observations for the spread of the new variants: At low prevalence new variants usually spread quickly and faster than existing variants (e.g. 20AEU1 or B.1.1.7 out-competed the previous variants). However once a certain level is reached and/or the measures are tightened, the spread of the new variants stabilises or reduces.

### Evidence for Competition Advantages due to Immune Escape

#### Observations for SARS-CoV-2
Variants with increased immune escape are observed in regions with high seroprevalences e.g. P1 in tropical Brazil. There this variants quickly replace existing variants. In other parts of the world P1 didn't spread that quickly.

#### Observations for other Coronaviruses
Both for the human endemic human coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, OC43 and E229) and coronaviruses of domestic animals (e.g. bovine coronaviruses) it is observed that new strains replace old strains. The new strains which out-competed the old strains usually do not yield increased waves or otherwise show higher transmissibility. However the new strains escape the previously acquired immune protections [citations coming].

#### Observed for other Respiratory Viruses
Influenza strains vary each season. 

### Evidence for Competition Advantages due to Faster Infections Cycles
#### Observed Spread of the Alpha Strain
Fast strains have been observed in situations when the measures are lessened (either by policy or because of lessened adherence): Alpha Variant in England, Ireland


## Biological Explanations

> **in work and incomplete**

### Why usually only One Variant Succeeds
Most respiratory tract virus infections yield cross immunity since the  immune system is alert to viruses: Usually only one virus at the time can infect the respiratory tract and the alertness of the immune system prevents other virus infections in the coming weeks (this is only true for virus infections and not bacteria or fungal infections since they require different immune responses. It is also not true if the immune system is out of shape). 
=> Only the first infecting variant is successful at infecting regardless whether a new SARS-2 variant manages to escape the acquired immunity, it most likely will fail to infect due to alertness.

### How Mutations directly effect Immune Evasion
Non synonymous mutations by definition alter the protein sequence. An altered protein sequence within antibody or T cell epitops can weaken or break the bindings and which weakens or break the associated immune response.

### How Mutations increase the Infection Speed
The spike proteins of coronaviruses usually need to be [primed] in one or several steps until the spikes under go the conformation change to induce membrane fusion.
