# Individual Susceptibility and Transmission

## Summary
Population groups with an adequate and in form immune system in the lungs mostly get mild diseases and are less infectious, these includes young people and especially children. For children Covid is no more or even less dangerous than other respiratory viruses. 
* [Transmission Distribution](#transmission-distribution): The transmission and spread varies across people: 20% are responsible for 80% of the infections. People from 5 to 29 years are less likely to get severely sick and transmit Covid less.
* [Schools and Children](#schools-and-children): Children are less susceptible to infection and they spread Covid less than adults. In schools if there were many infected this is mostly due to super spreading teachers and not children infecting each other.


## Relevance
Knowing how transmissions are distributed, helps to set and fine-tune control measures. *If measures are necessary*.
* Measures can few for those contributing few to the spread: children are not the carriers of the Covid spread and thus measures should not target them. 
* People with higher R values can be offered better control options: E.g. test access combined with [relaxed but adequate quarantine](../7_social/controlling.md#covid-19-cases-and-quarantine), optimal masks (e.g. custom fit FFP2 including advice) and better education how to handle covid.

> In my opinion, the actions for people with higher R values should always be options to take and *never be any restrictions* on human rights or any other any restrictions with outcast effects.


### Infector Distribution
The infector distribution is highly skewed:
* Contact tracing in Hong Kong revealed that [Adam et al](#summary-adam):
  * 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
  * 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
  * 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in quarantine)
* A spread analysis (SEIR model based on sequencing and epidemiological data) in Israel in spring 2020 shows that between 2% and 5% of the population contribute for 80% of the spread ([Miller et al](#summary-miller)). Comment: The simulation show that if the actual cases were several fold higher than the actual cases, 2% of the population are responsible for 80% of the spread. This is likely the case since experience shows that even the best detection schemes miss the majority of cases.

### Observed Transmission Rates
* [Hall et al](#summary-hall) reveal by analyzing "Household Transmission Evaluation Data" in England:
  * people between 5 and 29 years have lower household transmission rates than the other groups. 
  * The household transmission is high between people over 40 years of approximately the same age.
  * Very young children (0 to 4 years) transmit Covid frequently to their parents or grandparents. 
    > Their immune system in the lungs is early in the training phase and additionally they may not have had contact with any coronaviruses and so they lack the cross immunity most older have acquired from the human endemic CoVs.
* Children are less susceptible and transmit Covid less than adults as discussed in the section [schools and children](#schools-and-children). Children also do not super spread since in school settings no super spreading can be traced back to children - the super-spreading events observed, were likely caused by teachers.

### Possible Causes for varying Transmissions
Possible reasons for the skewed distribution are:
* *Socioeconomic conditions:*
  [Living Conditions](#living-space-and-income) influence transmission chains: People with small living space or small income have higher average R values.
* *Individuality of Virus Shedding:*
  Viral shedding is highly individual. Being infected does not imply one sheds infectious virions. The viral shedding depends on where the infection is, the respiratory behavior (e.g. breathing pattern, coughing, sneezing) and the physiology of the respiratory tract. How many small particulates persons produce is highly individual and tends to increase with age, male sex and BMI. Described on in [particle sources](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#particles-sources). Other factors such as immune system preparedness and behavior are also important.
* *Behavior:* How people behave is different.
  * Some might notice symptoms, some not. Symptoms can be wrongly attributed to something else.
  * For some it is easy to adapt the behavior and take precautions, for some it is not.
  

### Infectors and Symptom Status
Note: The strains prevalent during the time of investigation is relevant since strains can induce varying immune responses e.g. coronaviruses can diminish or activate the immune system.
* In early 2020 over 80% developed symptoms [to check and cite]
* In late 2020 many people had no symptoms [to check and cite]

* [Adam et al](#summary-adam) found in January through April in Hong Kong 2020 only 2.2% (7 in 309) of the infections were caused by pre-symptomatic people.
* The two mass infection events observed in airplanes were both caused by symptomatic infectors [Freedman and Wilder-Smith](#freedman). 
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that in household settings symptomatic infectors cause about 3 times as many infections as pre/asymptomatic infectors. 


### Schools and Children
Children are less likely to be infectees and less likely to be infectors.

A recommended review is [COVID-19 Transmission and Children: The Child Is Not to Blame](#leeraszka) by B. Lee and W. Raszka. Notable findings from the studies are below and summaries of most studies are in [Summarized References](#summarized-references).

* [Dattner et al](#summary-dattner) observed that children are relative to adults
  * less susceptible 45% [40%, 55%]) 
  * somewhat less infectious 85% [65%, 110%])
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that children are only about half as likely to get infected in households compared to adults (spouses which are most likely to get infected and the adult infections are biased by relationship habits).
* [Vlachos, Hertegard and Svaleryd](#summary-vlachossvaleryd) found that parents children in the 9th school year (open schools)had about the same incidence rate for Covid-19 as parents children in the 10th school year (closed school). If adjusted for factors such as age and occupation the risk was about 15% higher for being diagnosed with Covid-19 when the child went to open schools. // Comment: this indicate that other factors are more important than whether the children go to school. 
* Large high school outbreak in Israel shortly after reopening of the schools. The outbreak was probably due to aerosol super-spreading from teacher(s) which was enable by densely populated rooms and the permanent use of air-conditioning [Summary Stein-Zamir](#summary-stein-zamir). 
* [Ehrhardt et al](#summary-ehrhardtbrockmann) observed in Baden-Wuertenberg between 19 May to 28 July:
  * 6 of 137 infected pupils infected a total of 11 other pupils (an R value contribution of below .1)
  * 3% of infections of children (0-19 year) could be traced back to schools. Where as 41% to families and 8% to festivals/events.
* [Perez-Lopez et al](#summary-perez-lopez) published statistics about viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from visits in Sidra Medicine, the main pediatric center in Qatar. They observed a significant 30 fold reduction for influenza A. A 30% reduction was observed for influenza B and Common HCoVs. //Comment: Their observations indicate that in school settings only the influenza A transmission is efficient and other viruses are transmitted mainly in setting other than schools. This in turn indicates that for most viruses adults play the major role in the transmission.

##### Methods
Remark: Working Paper
* "Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions."
* the incidence rates were adjusted using logistic regression for wage, sex, occupation, educational attainment, income, regions of residence and of origin. OLS was used too. 

##### Results
* Comparison of Covid-19 incidences between parents with children in schools and homeschooling:
  * unadjusted the Covid incidence were near the same 5.67 versus 5.66 (Table 2)
  * adjusted the risk for parents with children in school was about 15% [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03–1.27] higher if adjusted with logistic regression(Table 1)
* "Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52–2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00–1.68]."

> ##### Comment
> It is not clear that the observed slightly increased Covid incidence of parents/teachers of lower secondary school children results from transmission from the children, it could also be attributed to parents visiting the schools and a transmission between adults.

##### Methods
Analyzing a large high school out break in Israel shortly after schools have been reopened. 

##### School Setting
* From 13 March to 17 May Schools in Israel were closed (limited opening for small children on 3 May)
* A heat wave with temperatures up to 40 degree from 19–21 May: 
  * "air-conditioning functioned continuously in all classes."
  * no face-masks
* "crowded classes: 35–38 students per class, class area 39–49 m2, allowing 1.1–1.3 m2 per student"

##### Results
* "Testing of the complete school community revealed 153 students (attack rate: 13.2%) and 25 staff members (attack rate: 16.6%) who were COVID-19 positive."
* "COVID-19 rates were higher in junior grades (7–9) than in high grades (10–12) (Figure 1). The peak rates were observed in the 9th grade (20 cases in one class and 13 cases in two other classes) and the 7th grade (14 cases in one class). Of the cases in teachers, four taught all these four classes, two taught three of the four classes and one taught two of these four classes."
* "Most student cases presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic."

PLoS Comput Biol 17(2): e1008559. <https://doi.org/ 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008559>
##### Methods
* "Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak (City close to Tel Aviv), Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR."
* The authors developed a model (discrete, stochastic and dynamic) for the propagation of Covid within a households. With this model infectivity and susceptibility of children and adults can be estimated and compared.
 
##### Findings
* "Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age."
* "We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults."

### Summary Lumley MarchJuly 21

#### Methods 
* Data Observation Duration: March 2020 to 28.2.2021
* Analyse the effect of seroconversion due to natural infection and vaccination on infection rates as part of the [OUCS testing](#testing-oucs).
* "Although an unexpected rise in incidence was seen in the first 2 weeks postvaccination, this time period was excluded from effectiveness calculations."

#### Results
##### Incidences Rates

Group |  case count | adjusted incidence ratio | 95% confidence interval
--|--|--|--
seronegative HCWs | 635 | ref | -
unvaccinated seropositive HCWs |12 | 0.15 | .08–.26 
seronegative, 1 dose vaccine vaccination | 64|0.36 | .26–.50
second vaccination | 2 | 0.10 | .02–.38

##### Viral Loads
* *By Symptom Status:* The median viral loads were higher, that is, lower Ct values lower in symptomatic infections (median [IQR] Ct: 16.3 [IQR 13.5–21.7]) compared to asymptomatic infections (Ct: 20 [IQR 14.5–29.5]) (Figure 4A, Kruskal-Wallis P < .001)." // since many asymptomatic individuals had low viral loads but high viral loads were observed in both groups.
* *By Immune Status:* "Unvaccinated seronegative HCWs had the highest viral loads (Ct: 18.3 [IQR 14.0–25.5]), followed by vaccinated previously seronegative HCWs (Ct: 19.7 [IQR 15.0–27.5]); unvaccinated seropositive HCWs had the lowest viral loads (Ct: 27.2 [IQR 18.8–32.2]) (Figure 4B, overall P = .06)." // low case count of unvaccinated seropositive

##### Vaccination Efficacy
* An increased infection risk in the first 2 weeks after vaccination especially for AstraZeneca
* From two weeks on after the first vaccine dose the rate of PCR positivity was reduce by about 65% (as described in incidence rates). The reduction was the same for BT162 and AstraZeneca. (Figure 3 )




### References Household Transmissions

> #### Comments on Household Transmissions
> * Even if the Covid prevalence is low, infected household members may community acquire the infection at the same event since the transmission is super-spreading-event driven and the disease onset can be hard to determine due to asymptomatic/low symptomatic cases and varying incubation times. Sensitivity analyses with varying the cut-off dates between symptom onsets help for symptomatic cases.
>  * If the community transmissions are high, the secondary attack rates needs correction for community acquired infections. Also commented at [Summary Madewell](#summary-madewell)].

International Journal of Epidemiology, Volume 50, Issue 3, June 2021, Pages 743–752, 
<https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab057>

##### Methods
"The Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset (HOSTED) is a passive surveillance system linking laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases to individuals living in the same household in England. We explored the risk of household transmission according to: age of case and contact, sex, region, deprivation, month and household composition between April and September 2020, building a multivariate model."

##### Results
The heat map (Figure 3 in the paper) shows the secondary cases by age of the index case and age of the contact:

![Heat map of secondary cases by age](images/hall_transmission_by_age.jpg)

* _Few Spread:_ People younger than 30 year but older than 4 have few secondary cases (left third of the image except left most column).
* _Much Spread:_ 
  * For index cases above 40 years the transmissions are high. The transmission rates peak at an age of about 65 years.
  * Very young children 0 to 4 of age transmit Covid well and mainly to their parents and their grand parents (left most column).
  * Parents between 40 and 59 transmit to older children (15-24) but the children not to them (hotspot at middle right, missing hotspot on the mirrored)

The graphs below show the secondary attack rate in the different administration division in the UK. 
![Transmission by regions](images/hall_secondary_cases_by_region.jpg)

The Southern regions have lower secondary attack rates likely due to the more comfortable climate in the summer months.

##### Methods Details
"As the incubation period for SAR-CoV-2 is thought to be 2–14 days [16],  we chose a threshold of 2 days between the specimen dates of the index and secondary cases as a pragmatic decision to offset the risks of misclassifying cases as either co-primary or as secondary. A sensitivity analysis using a cut-off of 4 days found to have little effect on any of the results or on the multivariable model. We have also made the implicit assumption that two (or more) cases oc- curring in a household within 2–14 days represents house- hold transmission when it also plausible that they are two independent community-acquired infections. However, given the timing of this study, when the number of cases was at its lowest, this risk is probably small." 

> // Considering the asymptomatic/low symptomatic cases, simultaneous community acquired infection (e.g. at a super spreading event) cannot be ruled out even with the sensitivity analysis by varying the incubation cut-offs.

##### Methods
Meta-Analysis of studies regarding the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in household settings. Many different kind of studies are included: 
* Covid diagnosis based on live tests (RT-PCR) or past infections with antibody tests, some studies included symptoms, a few studies do whole-genome sequencing, some studies are in settings (area and times) of high prevalence.
* The influence of the different factors (contact type, symptom status, adult/child contacts, sex, relationship to index case, number of contacts in household, ...) is analyzed.

##### Findings
Secondary Attach Rates with different groups as **infectors**. The error rate is in brackets. 
* household: 0.19 (0.4); family including non household contacts: 0.18 (0.5)
* symptomatic: 0.2 (0.6); pre- or asymptomatic: 0.07 (0.04)

Secondary Attach Rates with different groups as **infectees**. The error rate is in brackets. 
* children: 0.16 (0.6); adults: 0.31 (1.2) // adults includes spouses
* spouse: 0.43 (1.6); other: 1.8 (0.8)

Proportion of households where a secondary transmission was observed:
* 0.32 (.025)

Comparison with SARS-1 or MERS:
* SARS-1: 0.06 (0.04)
* MERS: 0.035 (0.035)

> ##### Comment
> Studies from countries with high and very high Covid prevalence are included too, in these countries independent infections pathways for different household members are very likely and thus inferring the secondary attack rate from the prevalence in household members overestimates the secondary attack rate.

Adam D, Wu P, Wong J, et al. Research Square; 2020. 
<https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-29548/v1>

##### Methods
"Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection."

##### Results
* Distribution of Infectivity:
  * 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
  * 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
  * 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in quarantine, Fig.2)
* "Gatherings in social settings such as bars, restaurants, weddings and religious sites appear to be at increased risk of superspreading events."
* "Transmission in social settings was significantly associated with an increased number of secondary cases compared to transmission observed in family households."
* Quarantine
  * Home quarantine yielded sporadic infections (2 observed) in family settings (Fig.2 d) and none outside families
  * Government quarantine yielded no further infections (Fig.2)
* "Of all cases confirmed in Hong Kong, 195 (18.8%, 195/1,038) were asymptomatic at confirmation (Supplementary Table 2) and, of these, most (83.1%, 162/195) were PCR-confirmed from 27 March onward" (Extended Data Fig.2)
* Infections caused by pre-symptomatic infectors were rarely observed: "Seven instances of likely pre-symptomatic transmission were observed where onset of the infectee preceded that of the infector or occurred on the same day."

##### Limitations
"These findings take advantage of the quality of case ascertainment and contact tracing data in Hong Kong, although some incompleteness in links between cases could potentially bias our estimates of transmission heterogeneity."

### References Spread Inferred from Sequences

#### Summary Miller
**Full genome viral sequences inform patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread into and within Israel**
##### Methods
212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences in combination with "high-resolution epidemiological data" are used to deduce the spread into and within Israel.
##### Results
* "We find that travelers returning from the United States of America significantly contributed to viral spread in Israel, more than their proportion in incoming infected travelers."
* "We further report high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 2-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections."
  * "Specifically, if we assume almost complete case reporting, our phylodynamic analysis indicates that between 5% and 10% of infections are responsible for 80% of secondary infections. With lower assumed levels of case reporting, less than 5% of infections would be responsible for 80% of secondary infections." // considering that SARS-CoV-2 tests have a detection rate of about 50% and many cases are missed by contact tracing, an upper bound of 1/3 for the case reporting seem reasonable in the Spring 2020 in Israel => the model predicts that about 2% are responsible for 80% of the infections (p_h = 0.02 in Fig 6)
##### Conclusions
* "Our results indicate that superspreading events drive the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that focused measures to reduce contacts of select individuals/social events could mitigate viral spread."
* The global connectivity allows for massive introductions which suggests the importance of border controls. //The authors als conclude shelter-in-place restriction for halting viral spread but as of July 2021 it is known that shelter-in-place likely increases and not decreases the spread due to indoor aerosol transmissions.
##### Method Details
* "We obtained RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal samples. Sequencing was performed based on the V3 Artic protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019)."
* "Instead of assuming a given level of transmission heterogeneity for Israel, we instead performed phylodynamic inference for the SEIR model across a range of transmission heterogeneities. Specifically, the SEIR-type model implemented two classes of infectious individuals, corresponding to a highly infectious subset of individuals (Ih) and a less
infectious subset of individuals (Il)." // Detail description in Methods>Phylodynamic analysis> Equation (1) - (5).



## Appendix

### Restrictions on Supposedly Increased R Value
> I am aware of the fact that many (governments, doctors, parliaments, citizens) around the world assume that currently available 'mRNA' and 'Adeno-virus-with-spike' vaccines are risk free and provide a useful protection against transmission. The supposedly reduced transmission and susceptibility is taken as a reason to restrict elementary rights and the freedom in varying degrees for those not vaccinated.

> It is scientific task to determine the properties/features that predicts whether someone is more or less likely to be infectious. One such feature is being vaccinated.
> Another scientific question is, which vaccines are safe. 

> Relevant moral questions are (some go fare beyond the above considerations):
> * Whether there should be restrictions for those being more likely infectious.
> * The relations between opening the windows  / keeping distance / wearing a mask / living healthily or unhealthily / getting vaccinated / removable chip implant /being young or old.
> * Who can say or has the right to say  something is safe, good or useful for somebody.
> * How and by who, how fast and which risks are estimated and weighted.
> * On different beliefs and world views.

> This is about *the present situation and the near future* and neither about the past nor the fare future. Sometimes historical comparisons are made. I think such comparisons fall short and are not helpful for an unbiased and rational discussion. E.g. in the middle ages the knowledge of natural sciences limited: Most diseases were not linked to pathogens and accordingly the transmission was often completely unknown. Situations around the fascist regimes in Europe in the 30s and 40s were also fundamentally different.
