# Transmission Distribution across Individuals
Knowing how transmissions are distributed, helps to set and fine-tune control measures if the measures are  needed:
* Measures can few for those contributing few to the spread: children are not the carriers of the Covid spread and thus measures should not target them. 
* People with higher R values can be offered better control measures: E.g. test access combined with [relaxed but adequate quarantine](../7_social/controlling.md#covid-19-cases-and-quarantine), optimal masks (e.g. custom fit FFP2 including advice) and better education how to handle covid.

> In my opinion, the actions for people with inherently higher R values should always be options to take and *never be any restrictions* on human rights or any other any restrictions with outcast effects.

> I am aware of the fact that many (governments, doctors, parliaments, citizens) around the world assume that currently available 'mRNA' and 'Adeno-virus-with-spike' vaccines are risk free and provide a useful protection against transmission. Even though no scientifically rigorous analyses are available proofing a useful transmission reduction for the delta variant [to my knowledge], a reduced transmission and susceptibility is assumed and taken as a reason to restrict elementary rights and the freedom in varying degrees for those not vaccinated.

> It is scientific task to determine the properties/features that predicts whether someone is more or less likely to be infectious. One such feature is being vaccinated.
  >> whether it provides a useful protection against transmission is unclear (to my judgement).
> Another scientific question is, which vaccines are safe. 

> Relevant moral questions are (some go fare beyond the above considerations):
> * Whether there should be restrictions for those being more likely infectious.
> * The relations between opening the windows  / keeping distance / wearing a mask / living healthily or unhealthily / getting vaccinated / removable chip implant /being young or old.
> * Who can say or has the right to say  something is safe, good or useful for somebody.
> * How and by who, how fast and which risks are estimated and weighted.
> * On different beliefs and world views.

> This is about *the present situation and the near future* and neither about the past nor the fare future. Sometimes historical comparisons are made. I think comparisons fall short and are not helpful for an unbiased and rational discussion. E.g. in the middle ages the knowledge of natural sciences and medicine especially was less and causal connections and a fundamental understanding was often missing. Situations around the fascist regimes in Europe in the 30s and 40s were also fundamentally different.


### Infector Distribution
The infector distribution is highly skewed:
* Contact tracing in Hong Kong revealed that [Adam et al](#summary-adam):
  * 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
  * 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
  * 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in quarantine)
* A spread analysis (SEIR model based on sequencing and epidemiological data) in Israel in spring 2020 shows that between 2% and 5% of the population contribute for 80% of the spread ([Miller et al](#summary-miller)). Comment: The simulation show that if the actual cases were several fold higher than the actual cases, 2% of the population are responsible for 80% of the spread. This is likely the case since experience shows that even the best detection schemes miss the majority of cases.

### Observed Transmission Rates
* [Hall et al](#summary-hall) reveal by analyzing "Household Transmission Evaluation Data" in England:
  * people between 5 and 29 years have much lower household transmission rates than the other groups. 
  * The household transmission is high between people over 40 years of approximately the same age.
  * Very young children (0 to 4 years) transmit Covid frequently to their parents or grandparents. 
    > Their immune system in the lungs is early in the training phase and additionally they may not have had contact with any coronaviruses and so they lack the cross immunity most older have acquired from the human endemic CoVs.
* Children are less susceptible and transmit Covid less than adults as discussed in the section [schools and children](#schools-and-children). Children also do not super spread since in school settings no super spreading can be traced back to children.

### Possible Causes for varying Transmissions
Possible reasons for the skewed distribution are:
* *Socioeconomic conditions:*
  [Living Conditions](#living-space-and-income) influence transmission chains: People with small living space or small income have higher average R values.
* *Individuality of Virus Shedding:*
  Viral shedding is highly individual. Being infected does not imply one sheds infectious virions. The viral shedding depends on where the infection is, the respiratory behavior (e.g. breathing pattern, coughing, sneezing) and the physiology of the respiratory tract. How many small particulates persons produce is highly individual and tends to increase with age, male sex and BMI. Described on in [particle sources](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#particles-sources). Other factors such as immune system preparedness and behavior are also important.
* *Behavior:* How people behave is different.
  * Some might notice symptoms, some not. Symptoms can be wrongly attributed to something else.
  * For some it is easy to adapt the behavior and take precautions, for some it is not.
  

### Infectors and Symptom Status
Note: The strains prevalent during the time of investigation is relevant since strains can induce varying immune responses e.g. coronaviruses can diminish or activate the immune system.
* In early 2020 over 80% developed symptoms [to check and cite]
* In late 2020 many people had no symptoms [to check and cite]

* [Adam et al](#summary-adam) found in January through April in Hong Kong 2020 only 2.2% (7 in 309) of the infections were caused by pre-symptomatic people.
* The two mass infection events observed in airplanes were both caused by symptomatic infectors [Freedman and Wilder-Smith](#freedman). 
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that in household settings symptomatic infectors cause about 3 times as many infections as pre/asymptomatic infectors. 


### Schools and Children
Children are less likely to be infectees and less likely to be infectors.

A recommended review is [COVID-19 Transmission and Children: The Child Is Not to Blame](#leeraszka) by B. Lee and W. Raszka. Notable findings from the studies are below and summaries of most studies are in [Summarized References](#summarized-references).

* [Dattner et al](#summary-dattner) observed that children are relative to adults
  * less susceptible 45% [40%, 55%]) 
  * somewhat less infectious 85% [65%, 110%])
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that children are only about half as likely to get infected in households compared to adults (spouses which are most likely to get infected and the adult infections are biased by relationship habits).
* [Vlachos, Hertegard and Svaleryd](#summary-vlachossvaleryd) found that parents children in the 9th school year (open schools)had about the same incidence rate for Covid-19 as parents children in the 10th school year (closed school). If adjusted for factors such as age and occupation the risk was about 15% higher for being diagnosed with Covid-19 when the child went to open schools. // Comment: this indicate that other factors are more important than whether the children go to school. 
* Large high school outbreak in Israel shortly after reopening of the schools. The outbreak was probably due to aerosol super-spreading from teacher(s) which was enable by densely populated rooms and the permanent use of air-conditioning [Summary Stein-Zamir](#summary-stein-zamir). 
* [Ehrhardt et al](#summary-ehrhardtbrockmann) observed in Baden-Wuertenberg between 19 May to 28 July:
  * 6 of 137 infected pupils infected a total of 11 other pupils (an R value contribution of below .1)
  * 3% of infections of children (0-19 year) could be traced back to schools. Where as 41% to families and 8% to festivals/events.
* [Perez-Lopez et al](#summary-perez-lopez) published statistics about viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from visits in Sidra Medicine, the main pediatric center in Qatar. They observed a significant 30 fold reduction for influenza A. A 30% reduction was observed for influenza B and Common HCoVs. //Comment: Their observations indicate that in school settings only the influenza A transmission is efficient and other viruses are transmitted mainly in setting other than schools. This in turn indicates that for most viruses adults play the major role in the transmission.

##### Methods
"We investigated data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected 0–19year olds, who attended schools/childcare facilities, to assess their role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission after these establishments’ reopening in May 2020 in Baden-Württemberg, Germany."

##### School Setting
50% Group Size: Yes, Cleaning of Surface: Yes, Regular Ventilation: Yes, Hygiene: Yes, Face Mask in Break: Some, Face Mask in Classroom: No, Physical Distancing: Some, No Singing: Most, Physical Education: No

##### Results
* Infection by pupils
  1. Total of 557 Covid-19 cases in the age group 0-19 year out of a total of 3104 cases in Badenwuertenberg in the study period (19.5-25.7)
  2. For 453 School attendance information was available
  3. 137 (30% of 453) were at least 1 day at school while infectious 
  4. 11 other pupils were infected by 6 of those 137
  5. no secondary infection from those 11 were detected despite extensive contact tracing
* only 15 (3%) of 453 infected children (with school attendance known) were infected in schools (the 11 above from other pupils and 4 by teachers). Most infections occurred in families or festivals/events (Table 2).

Jonas Vlachos, Edvin Hertegard, Helena Svaleryd

##### Methods
Remark: Working Paper
* "Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions."
* the incidence rates were adjusted using logistic regression for wage, sex, occupation, educational attainment, income, regions of residence and of origin. OLS was used too. 

##### Results
* Comparison of Covid-19 incidences between parents with children in schools and homeschooling:
  * unadjusted the Covid incidence were near the same 5.67 versus 5.66 (Table 2)
  * adjusted the risk for parents with children in school was about 15% [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03–1.27] higher if adjusted with logistic regression(Table 1)
* "Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52–2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00–1.68]."

> ##### Comment
> It is not clear that the observed slightly increased Covid incidence of parents/teachers of lower secondary school children results from transmission from the children, it could also be attributed to parents visiting the schools and a transmission between adults.

##### Methods
Analyzing a large high school out break in Israel shortly after schools have been reopened. 

##### School Setting
* From 13 March to 17 May Schools in Israel were closed (limited opening for small children on 3 May)
* A heat wave with temperatures up to 40 degree from 19–21 May: 
  * "air-conditioning functioned continuously in all classes."
  * no face-masks
* "crowded classes: 35–38 students per class, class area 39–49 m2, allowing 1.1–1.3 m2 per student"

##### Results
* "Testing of the complete school community revealed 153 students (attack rate: 13.2%) and 25 staff members (attack rate: 16.6%) who were COVID-19 positive."
* "COVID-19 rates were higher in junior grades (7–9) than in high grades (10–12) (Figure 1). The peak rates were observed in the 9th grade (20 cases in one class and 13 cases in two other classes) and the 7th grade (14 cases in one class). Of the cases in teachers, four taught all these four classes, two taught three of the four classes and one taught two of these four classes."
* "Most student cases presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic."

PLoS Comput Biol 17(2): e1008559. <https://doi.org/ 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008559>
##### Methods
* "Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak (City close to Tel Aviv), Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR."
* The authors developed a model (discrete, stochastic and dynamic) for the propagation of Covid within a households. With this model infectivity and susceptibility of children and adults can be estimated and compared.
 
##### Findings
* "Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age."
* "We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults."

### Summary Lumley MarchJuly 21

#### Methods 
* Data Observation Duration: March 2020 to 28.2.2021
* Analyse the effect of seroconversion due to natural infection and vaccination on infection rates as part of the [OUCS testing](#testing-oucs).

#### Results
##### Incidences Rates
"Rates of any PCR-positive result, irrespective of symptoms, were highest in unvaccinated seronegative HCWs (635 cases), with 85% lower incidence in unvaccinated seropositive HCWs (12 cases, aIRR = 0.15 [95% CI .08–.26, P < .001]). Incidence was reduced by 64% in seronegative HCWs following first vaccination (64 cases, aIRR = 0.36 [95% CI .26–.50; P < .001]) and 90% following second vaccination (2 cases, aIRR = 0.10 [95% CI .02–.38; P < .001]) (Figures 1C and 2, Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2). " //vaccination two weeks after first dose.

##### Viral Loads
* "Viral loads were higher, that is, Ct values lower, in symptomatic infections (median [IQR] Ct: 16.3 [IQR 13.5–21.7]) compared to asymptomatic screening (Ct: 20 [IQR 14.5–29.5]) (Figure 4A, Kruskal-Wallis P < .001)." // since many asymptomatic individuals had low viral loads but high viral loads were observed in both groups.
* "Unvaccinated seronegative HCWs had the highest viral loads (Ct: 18.3 [IQR 14.0–25.5]), followed by vaccinated previously seronegative HCWs (Ct: 19.7 [IQR 15.0–27.5]); unvaccinated seropositive HCWs had the lowest viral loads (Ct: 27.2 [IQR 18.8–32.2]) (Figure 4B, overall P = .06)." // low case count of unvaccinated seropositive

##### Vaccination Efficacy
* An increased infection risk in the first 2 weeks after vaccination especially for AstraZeneca
* From two weeks on after the first vaccine dose the rate of PCR positivity was reduce by about 65% (as described in incidence rates). The reduction was the same for BT162 and AstraZeneca. (Figure 3 )
