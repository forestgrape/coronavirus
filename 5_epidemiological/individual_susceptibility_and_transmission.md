## Summary

Most epidemiological analyses specify SARS-CoV-2 infections with the observables a "commonly detectable" viral load in the upper respiratory tract or symptoms. Sampling the upper respiratory tract is not perfectly predictive for the overall viral load since most SARS-CoV-2 virions infect cells in the conducting airways.  Nevertheless the viral load in the upper respiratory tract samples is correlated to symptoms. Symptomatic persons in turn ([Transmission by Symptom Status](#spread-by-symptom-status)) are more likely to transmit Covid. Most (nearly all?) superspreading events described, are caused by symptomatic persons, likely because superspreading involves high numbers of virions in the conducting airways, which usually causes symptoms.

How much individuals contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is highly variable. Most observations conclude that 20% of the infectees are responsible for at least 80% of the infections ([Transmission Distribution](#transmission-distribution)). The individual transmission is associated to both biological and social factors. Social factors include the living situation and the behavior. Biological factors influencing susceptibility and infectiousness. These biological factors are discussed in the following.

People with an adequate and sensitive immune system control coronavirus infections early and if at all only mild symptoms are induced. Apart from a possible initial localized burst mainly in the upper respiratory tract, coronaviruses usually do *not* replicate to high numbers. Low numbers of coronaviruses don't cause severe disease and are associated with a low probability of transmission and detection. This theoretical argumentation is supported by the observations:
* People with regular movement are about 30 % less likely to get both mild respiratory diseases including Covid. An even further reduction is observed for severe diseases. A healthy diet helps to maintain a good microbiome in the intestine which is important for the overall immunity.
* Long-time exposure to air pollution, few movement and obesity can reduce the capability of the respiratory tract to handle viruses. [Air Pollution](#dirty-air-exposure) und [overweight](#overweight) both increase the Covid risk as observations of individuals and observation at the population level suggest.
* A major determinant how the body can handle SARS-CoV-2 is age, especially for the initial infection. Young people are less susceptible to get a disease and usually control the viral load timely and in agreement are less infectious ([Transmission by Age Groups](#transmission-by-age)). This is especially true for the age from 5 to 25 years: Few spread is observed between children and in schools. Superspreading with children as index cases is nearly never observed.

The immune system can learn from exposures and induce an improved protection against subsequent similar exposures (this remembering can include the classical acquired immune responses such as T cells and B cells capable to produce antibodies. Infections usually induce a location specific adaptions).

Previous infections provide a reliable and long lasting protection:
* The protection against hospitalization is above 95%.
* The chance to test positive is reduced by about 80% to 90%. The protections is stable across time and mostly across variants. The chance to have a high viral load (Ct value <30) and symptoms is reduced by more than 90% [to confirm].

The muscular administrated 'mRNA' and adenovirus vectored vaccines induce mainly a systemic immunity. Accordingly the protection against pneumonia (=severe Covid) is good. On the other hand the protection against infections and transmission is mediocre and last only a few months:
* *Protection against pneumonia and hospitalization:* Accordingly to the systemic immunity provided, a good protection against hospitalization: most investigations conclude a reduction of at least 70 % in the first half year after vaccination.
* *Protection against infection:* In the first few months after vaccination the chance to test positive (the detection limit is usually at 40 PCR cycles which is about 1000 cps/milliliter) is reduced and during this time the probability for high viral loads is even further reduced. The protection gradually decreases and vanishes about 3 to 6 months after vaccination (depends individual factors and SARS-2 variants present). The chance for testing positive after exposure is reduced by about 70% for BNT162b2 in the first 2 months and then gradually decreases and the reduction is lost about 3 to 6 months after vaccination against the delta variant. The ChAdOx1 initially reduces the chances to test positive by about 50%. While ChAdOx1 starts lower than BNT162b2 the decay of protection is slower. The protection from mRNA-1273 starts and stays higher than BNT162b2/ChAd0x1. 
* *Protection against Transmission:* Some studies observe in the phase when the vaccine induced immunity reduces the viral load, a reduced onwards transmission from vaccinated index cases; other studies observe no difference even in this  phase. After a few months when the viral load in the  tract are the same as for unvaccinated people, there seems to be no reduction, at least in household settings.

> The widespread assumption that vaccinated people transmit Covid less for more than a few months *lacks* a rigorous scientific basis. To my judgement, there is neither an epidemiological nor a medical benefit/basis to (push to) vaccinate people not at risk for severe Covid.

> In my opinion, the actions for people with higher R values should always be options to take and *never be any restrictions* on human rights or any other any restrictions with outcast effects. Further discussed in [considerations on increased R value](../7_social/individual_measures.md#considerations-on-increased-r-value).


## Relevance
Knowing how transmissions are distributed, helps to set and fine-tune control measures. *If measures are necessary*.
* Measures can few for those contributing few to the spread: children  and young adults are not the carriers of the Covid spread and thus measures should not target them.
* People with higher R values can be offered control options: E.g. free test access, suitable masks (e.g. custom fit FFP2 including advice on wearing them) and better education how to handle covid.



## Observables for Covid Infections
To analyze susceptibility and transmissions, one needs to specify which the SARS-CoV-2 infections to count and how to diagnose them. Diagnosis is traditionally geared toward diagnosing a disease to possibly initiate a treatment, discussed in the chapter [Diagnosis and Viral Load](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md).

Detection of infections for epidemiological investigations is mostly done by:
* Symptoms
* Hospitalizations, Deaths
* Viral load
* Antibody detection for previous infections

Since SARS-CoV-2 so fare hardly causes any deaths and hospitalizations in healthy people below 50, the viral load or symptoms are mostly used for epidemiological investigations.


### Association between Viral Load and Symptoms
* [Lumley et al](#summary-lumley-march-21) observe for the viral loads taken by nasal and oropharyngeal swabs: symptomatic infections (median [IQR] Ct: 16.3 [IQR 13.5–21.7]) compared to asymptomatic infections (Ct: 20 [IQR 14.5–29.5]). Previously infected persons tend to have a lower viral load (higher Ct values) than seronegative persons or vaccinated persons:

![Viral Loads by Symptoms and Vaccination](images/lumley_march_figure4.jpeg)

* [Regev-Yochay et al](#summary-regev-yochay) find for health care workers (vaccinated and unvaccinated) a mean Ct value of 21.7 for symptomatic cases and 25.8 for asymptomatic cases.



### Proportion of symptomatic Patients

> The proportion of symptomatic patients is likely subject to various factors such as the SARS-CoV-2 variants present and the climate conditions. Therefore the dates and locations are stated from which both the variants prevalent and the climate conditions can be inferred.

#### Early 2020
The symptomatic proportion of cases varied through back since early 2020:
* [Adam et al](#summary-adam) observe that until 27 March 2020 nearly everybody was symptomatic. Then abruptly from 27 March onwards the proportion of asymptomatic cases increased to about 40 %. // This could be due to the lineages having the D614G mutation.

#### Early 2021
* During the third Covid wave in Israel peaking around mid January 2021 about  [Regev-Yochay et al](#summary-regev-yochay) about 60 % of unvaccinated and about 50 % of vaccinated persons are asymptomatic.


### Spread by Symptom Status
Note: The strains prevalent during the time of investigation is relevant since strains can induce varying immune responses e.g. coronaviruses can diminish or activate the immune system.
* [Adam et al](#summary-adam) found in January through April in Hong Kong 2020 only 2.2% of the infections (7 out of 309) were caused by pre-symptomatic people.
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that in household settings symptomatic infectors cause about 3 times as many infections as pre/asymptomatic infectors.




## Viral Load in Epidemiology

### Viral Load Interpretation
Like infections with the other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 infections are not per se pathogenic just if SARS-2 replicates to very high numbers at the wrong locations. If SARS-2 viruses are causing uneasiness, one has the disease [Covid-19](./../3_medical/covid19.md). Very high numbers of viruses in the lungs can cause severe or even deadly pneumonia (Chapter Viral Load: section [Viral Load in the Lungs](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md#balf)). Coronaviruses in health and disease are discussed in the chapter [Virobiota](./virome.md).


### Limit of Detection
The detection limit is mostly due to technical limits and not that lower viral loads are not frequently. Low viral load cause only rarely a disease and so for disease diagnosis a limit of detection of 10^3 to 10^4  copies per milliliter (corresponds to 35 to 40 cycles for most apparatuses) is more than good enough. As noted, coronaviruses living as commensal microorganisms in the human respiratory tract in healthy state are usually low in numbers and therefore only detected with a low probability. Some note on PCR accuracy in the chapter [PCR Diagnosis](./../3_medical/pcr_diagnosis.md). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections with a focus on disease causing infections is discussed in the chapter [Diagnosis](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md).


### Viral Load Distribution
The viral load of a population sample has a continuous distribution. 

#### Ct Value Plots
The distribution of the Ct values often looks left skewed with many increasing frequencies towards higher Ct values and towards the PCR cutoff the distribution then sharply decreases towards the Ct value detection limit. This is not reflecting the actual viral load distribution since towards the detection limit the PCR sensitivity decreases which causes the Ct distribution to be increasingly chopped off at high Ct values. The actual distribution just continues below the LOD and then gradually decreases.

#### Viral Load Distribution Shifts

##### Viral Load Shift by Immunity
The same effect how the building up the vaccine immunity shifts the viral load distribution is also observed by [Regev-Yochay et al](#summary-regev-yochay) when the vaccine induced immunity builds up (fully vaccinated is 10 days after the 2nd dose) in their cohort of hospital staff.

![Viral Load by Vaccination Status](images/ry_viral_load.jpg)

According to the distribution shift, the detection rates decrease respectively the protection rates for CT values below 30/40 gradually increase:

Status  | reduction Ct<40 | reduction Ct<30
--|--|--
unvacc     | 0 % (ref) | 0 % (ref)
early vacc | 29 % | 45 %
part. vacc | 55 % | 59 %
fully vacc | 66 % | 70 %


<!--
Increased immune protection induces a shift of the distribution of the viral loads towards lower values (respectively higher Ct values). This is illustrated as violin plot by [Pritchard et al](#summary-pritchard):
![viral load distribution violin plot Pritchard]

> This are [Ct value plots](#ct-value-plots) so they are chopped of towards the detection limit and the actual viral load distribution would probably peak at 10 cp/milliliter which translates to an imaginary Ct value of 45 in the case of seropositive persons.
-->



##### Viral Load Shift by Age
A shift in the viral load distribution is observed for different age groups. The graphics below, by [Lyngse et al](#summary-lyngse), visualizes the viral load distribution for different age groups. For children from 5 to 10 years the CT values plots are shifted towards higher CT values. From 10 to 20 there quite a lot of variation in the viral load and still many values towards the cutoff boarder indicating that many individuals have viral loads which are not reliably detected. For people above 80 years the viral load distribution is more centered.

![Viral Load Distribution Children by Lyngse](images/lyngse_F6.jpg)

#### Relation between Viral Load Distribution and Positivity Rate
> Explorative section.

Considering the unbounded viral load distributions, the PCR cutoff values of 30, 35 or 40 PCR cycles are just arbitrary cutoffs and yield the number of samples below these values. So a positive test defined by 30 cycles - say 10^6 copies/milliliter - just detects all samples with a higher viral load (when away from the PCR detection limit, when close to the border samples are not detected with a certain probability since towards the detection limit the PCR accuracy is lost {[PCR Diagnosis](./../3_medical/pcr_diagnosis.md)}). 

##### Hypothesis
*As long as the distribution is shifted 'uniformly' (the true viral load distribution not the Ct value distribution), a 1 to 1 correspondence between the viral load distribution shift and the number of samples above or below a certain threshold value is expected.*

So if an immune protection reduces the viral loads when sampling at a given location, the positivity rate is reduced and the other way round. E.g.:
* If natural immunity reduces the viral load, it reduces the chance for a positive test (can be a PCR test with a cutoff of 30 or 40 as described in [Viral Load Shift by Immunity](#viral-load-shift-by-immunity)).
* Accordingly for vaccination: If vaccines fail to shift the viral load towards lower values the vaccines have no effects on testing positive at the given location => *if vaccinated persons have about the same viral load distribution as unvaccinated persons, the vaccines do not offer a protection for infection at the location the viral load is measured.*



### Spread by Viral Load
How many virions are at the different locations in the respiratory tract and how much particulates are exhaled from each location determine the amount of virions exhaled. The number of exhaled viruses is a major determinant for transmission - however the viral load in the URT (e.g. nose) can be quite different from the number of exhaled virions (Chapter Viral Load: [Viral Load in Exhaled Air](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md#viral-load-and-infectiousness)). On average however the viral load in URT predicts transmission. The following graphics from [Lynsge et al](#summary-lyngse) shows the household transmission risk and rate by the viral load (risk=at least one contact infected and rate=infected/exposed):

![transmission by viral load](images/lyngse_F1.jpg)





## Infector Distribution

### Observed Infector Distribution
The infector distribution is highly skewed:
* Contact tracing in Hong Kong revealed that [Adam et al](#summary-adam):
  * 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
  * 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
  * 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in quarantine)

* [Illingworth et al](#summary-illingworth) analyse transmission in a hospital settings.  They find that 10% of infectors cause about 50% of the infection and about 20% cause about 80% of the infections. Notably, most infections were caused by patients being treated in non Covid wards.

* A spread analysis (SEIR model based on sequencing and epidemiological data) in Israel in spring 2020 shows that between 2% and 5% of the population contribute for 80% of the spread ([Miller et al](#summary-miller)). Comment: The simulation infers that if the actual cases were several fold higher than the actual cases, 2% of the population are responsible for 80% of the spread. This is likely the case since experience shows that even the best detection schemes miss the majority of cases.


### Possible Causes for uneven Spread

#### Possible Biological Causes
* *Individuality of SARS-CoV-2 Infections*
  SARS-CoV-2 infections are highly individual and situation specific.
  * One reason is the immune system which in turn is influence by [age and the associated exposure to pathogens](../4_immunological/ontogenesis_and_locality_of_immunity.md). Young people tend to have a strong innate immune system which prevents SARS-CoV-2 to replicate to high numbers. The immune system of adults however, relies more on the acquired immunity from previously encountered pathogens. If a good immune response is not fast enough, in the big surface of the lower respiratory tract SARS-2 can replicate to high numbers. High viral in the lower respiratory tract can cause super spreading and severe Covid.
  * *Situation specific Transmission:* In the lower respiratory tract the immune system can control viruses less well. [Dry particulates enter the lungs well](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md) and accordingly [most spread of severe Covid is in dry air](./spread_analyses.md).
* *Individuality of Respiratory Tract Particle Shedding:*
  Viral shedding is highly individual. Being infected does not imply one sheds infectious virions. The viral shedding depends on where the infection is, the respiratory behavior (e.g. breathing pattern, coughing, sneezing) and the physiology of the respiratory tract. How many small particulates persons produce is highly individual and tends to increase with age, male sex and BMI. Described on in [particle sources](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#particles-sources). Other factors such as immune system preparedness and behavior are also important.

#### Possible Social Causes
* *Socioeconomic conditions:*
  [Living Conditions](./spread_analyses.md#living-space-and-income) influence transmission chains: People with small living space or small income have higher average R values.
* *Behavior:* How people behave is different.
  * Some might notice symptoms, some not. Symptoms can be wrongly attributed to something else.
  * For some it is easy to adapt the behavior and take precautions, for some it is not.



## Effects of Movement
People with regular movement are less likely for a symptomatic disease. Additionally if positive or symptomatic, the risk for severe disease and hospitalization is reduced as outlined in the chapter [Movement](../6_prevention_and_treatment/movement.md).



## Associations to BMI

### Geographical Observations of High Overweight Prevalence
*High Overweight Prevalence is associated to High Covid Prevalence and Death Rates*

* *Observations:*
    Countries with high rates of obesity tend to have much more severe cases than countries with lower rates but otherwise similar characteristics.

    Selected countries with high rates of obesity (in decreasing order, source: obesity.procon.org):
    US, Jordan, Turkey, Mexico, UK, Hungary, Israel, Czechia

    Few obesity: Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Japan

* *Possible Explanation:*
    * One reason is for the many severe cases, is that obesity itself increases the risk for severe Covid. But the case counts seem to increase overall i.e. also in people which are not obese [to check and cite/provide evidence]. 
    * A possible biological explanation is that the mucus clearance is inversely proportional to the BMI which increases susceptibility for infection and the risk for a high viral load (some notes in [Increase the Mucus Flow](../6_prevention_and_treatment/increasing_the_mucus_flow.md)). High BMI also increases the exhaled aerosol (chapter [Particles in the Respiratory Tract](transmission.md#particle-dynamics-in-the-respiratory-tract)).




## Effects of Dirty Air Exposure
*In short:* Dirty Air Exposure is associated to a high Prevalence of Severe Covid.

### Air Pollution
_Through Air Pollution_: High rates of air pollution occur frequently in industrialized densely populated regions which have inversion weather situations (usually in the winter). Examples (order: most polluted air first, source: estimates from watching the maps at ventusky.com): northern India, central and northern China (including Wuhan), northern Italy, Tehran

Specifically for Italy a correlation between Covid and air pollution is shown by [Kotsiou et al](#kotsiou).

### Smoking
_Through Smoking_: Smokers and Ex-Smokers. Ex-smokers have a higher risk for severe risk than never smokers. For current smoker the risk is similar or only slightly higher than for never smokers.

* [Simons et al](#simons) is a meta analysis with studies from across the world.

> The overall health benefits of a smoke stop outweigh by fare a possible increased Covid incidence: Current smokers seem to have no higher Covid risk than never smokers, but a lower risk than former smokers. This could be caused by (possibly toxic) environment changes in the lung when smoking. [Local environment changes in the lungs](../6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) can also be achieved with sauna or steam inhalation which don't have the possibility of health hazards which smoke has.

## Transmissions by Age

### Household Transmission by Age

#### Household Transmission in the UK
[JA Hall et al](#summary-ja-hall) reveal by analyzing "Household Transmission Evaluation Data" in England:
* people between 5 and 29 years have lower household transmission rates than the other groups. 
* The household transmission is high between people over 40 years of approximately the same age.
* Very young children (0 to 4 years) transmit Covid frequently to their parents or grandparents. 
  > Their immune system in the lungs is early in the training phase and additionally they may not have had contact with any coronaviruses and so they lack the cross immunity most older have acquired from the human endemic CoVs.

The observed transmissions by the age of the index cases (x-axis) and the contacts (y-axis) in households visualized (Figure 3 in [Hall et al](#summary-ja-hall)):

![Heat map of secondary cases by age](images/hall_transmission_by_age.jpg)

* A very similar transmission pattern is also observed in the Netherlands by [van der Hoek et al](#van-der-hoek). The transmission pattern shown in "Figuur" in their paper is very similar to the results shown above. The article is in dutch and for this reason is not considered any further.

#### Household Transmission in Denmark
> Analyzing the household transmission by age is tricky, since older people often live in small households whereas children often in larger households. In larger households the attack rates (probability of infection) usually are lower e.g. there are usually several rooms. So in large household with children, an observed lower transmission rate, could be either due to the lower transmission rates of children or the larger household size. [Lyngse et al](#summary-lyngse) tackle this, by defining the transmission risk as a least one transmission occurring and the transmission rate as the proportion of transmissions occurring. The transmission risk is excepted to be higher in larger households while the transmission rate is excepted to be higher in small households since in the latter people tend to be closer together.

[Lyngse et al](#summary-lyngse) observe:  
* *Infants and young children:* 
  * In the case of infants and young children the transmissions are low at low viral loads but increase with higher viral loads. However, as visualized in the section viral load by age in infants and young children a high viral load is rare.
  * The transmission risk increases more than the transmission rate likely since they tend to live in larger households. Possibly, small children infect their mother but the risk siblings and father is likely lower.
* Teenagers and young adults are about half as infectious compared to people above 50. Even with high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract teenagers and young adults on average cause relatively few transmissions.
* With increasing age, the transmissions get higher. // The transmission risk plateaus from 40 to 60 likely since the household size decreases. 

as visible from their graphics:

![transmission by age and viral load](images/lyngse_F8.jpg)

The transmission rate (left graphics above) from age to age for the different quartiles is visualized as follows by [Lyngse et al](#summary-lyngse).

> As the graph above by Hall from the UK patterns but from Denmark and split into viral load quartiles; the color-scales vary and are bounded by the maximal values observed in each quartile.

![transmission from age to age by viral load](images/lyngse_F10.jpg)


#### Household Transmission in Israel
[Dattner et al](#summary-dattner) observe that children are relative to adults
* less susceptible 45% [40%, 55%]
* somewhat less infectious 85% [65%, 110%]


#### Household Transmission Meta-Analysis
The meta-analysis by [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) concludes that children are only about half as likely to get infected in households compared to adults (spouses are most likely to get infected, the adult infections are subject to relationship habits).



### Susceptibility and Spread of Children

#### Transmissions in Schools
Children are less likely to be tested positive and less likely to be infectors. Children also do not super spread since in school settings no super spreading can be traced back to children - the super-spreading events observed, were likely caused by teachers.

A recommended review is [COVID-19 Transmission and Children: The Child Is Not to Blame](#leeraszka) by B. Lee and W. Raszka.

* [Vlachos, Hertegard and Svaleryd](#summary-vlachossvaleryd) found that parents children in the 9th school year (open schools)had about the same incidence rate for Covid-19 as parents children in the 10th school year (closed school). If adjusted for factors such as age and occupation the risk was about 15% higher for being diagnosed with Covid-19 when the child went to open schools. // Comment: this indicate that other factors are more important than whether the children go to school. 
* Large high school outbreak in Israel shortly after reopening of the schools. The outbreak was probably due to aerosol super-spreading from teacher(s) which was enable by densely populated rooms and the permanent use of air-conditioning [Summary Stein-Zamir](#summary-stein-zamir). 
* [Ehrhardt et al](#summary-ehrhardtbrockmann) observed in Baden-Wuertenberg between 19 May to 28 July:
  * 6 of 137 infected pupils infected a total of 11 other pupils (an R value contribution of below .1)
  * 3% of infections of children (0-19 year) could be traced back to schools. Where as 41% to families and 8% to festivals/events.
* [Perez-Lopez et al](#summary-perez-lopez) published statistics about viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from visits in Sidra Medicine, the main pediatric center in Qatar. They observed a significant 30 fold reduction for influenza A. A 30% reduction was observed for influenza B and Common HCoVs. //Comment: Their observations indicate that in school settings only the influenza A transmission is efficient and other viruses are transmitted mainly in setting other than schools. This in turn indicates that most respiratory viruses are transmitted primarily by adults.



### Susceptibility and Spread of Young Adults

* [Reyes et al](#reyes) conclude by analyzing seroprevalences that no increased transmission occurs in student dormitories.
* From [Household Transmission by Age](#household-transmission-by-age) it is visible that young adults mostly don't spread SARS-CoV-2 infections much.


### Biological Explanation for Age Effects
The immune system of young people is built to handle unseen viruses ([Immune System throughout Life](../4_immunological/ontogenesis_and_locality_of_immunity.md)). For children SARS-2 is no more or even less dangerous than other respiratory viruses, it is just another new coronavirus.
With increasing age the innate sensing mechanisms are diminished, which can give SARS-CoV-2 the opportunity to replicate to high numbers which in turn increases the probability for transmission and for severe disease. 




## Effects of Acquired Immunity

### Effects of Natural Infection
* [Lumley et al](#summary-lumley-march-21) observe a protection of 85% against testing positive for staff in the Oxford Uni hospitals.
* [VJ Hall et al](#summary-vj-hall-april-21) observe a protection of 85% against testing positive at NHS hospitals in the UK.

### Vaccine Induced Immunity

#### Peak Protection of BNT162b2
The protection of BNT162b2 is highest from about 10 days after the 2nd does until about 6 weeks afterwards (depend several factors such as age and variants present) and then starts decreasing.

* [Regev-Yochay et al](#summary-regev-yochay) find that for vaccinated persons the mean is about 22 and for unvaccinated about 27 Ct cycles NPS. The vaccine protection against is 66 % for a viral load <40 PCR cycles and 70% for a viral load <30 PCR cycles.
* [VJ Hall et al](#summary-vj-hall-april-21) observe that BNT162b2 provides protection of 75% against testing positive for SARS-2 in the staff of the UK NHS hospitals in about the first 6 weeks after the 2nd dose.


#### Vaccine Time Varying Effects

##### Building Up Vaccines Induced Immunity
The viral load viral load decreases (the Ct values increase) in a steady way with increased protection from vaccination (Maximal protection is achieved from about 10 days after the second dose). These effects are described in more detail in the section [viral load shifts](#viral-load-by-vaccination).

##### Waning of Vaccine Induced Immunity
[to be done]
sweden study, us and israel 

#### Vaccine Effects on Transmission
Vaccines usually reduce the probability to get infected. Some vaccines (depends on the vaccine and the virus type) also reduce the probability for ongoing transmission once infected.

##### Vaccines on the Transmission of SARS-CoV-2
* [Singanayagam](#singanayagam) find that the SAR in household contacts exposed to fully vaccinated index cases was 25% (17 got infected of 69 exposed) and the SAR in household contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases is 23% (23 got infected of 100 exposed). => vaccines don't change transmission rates in households settings once infected, the vaccines did induce a slightly faster virus clearance however.
* [Harris et al](#summary-harris) observe a reduction for 1 time vaccinated index cases when the contacts are unvaccinated of about 40%. However when the contacts are also vaccinated there seems to be no reduction. The results thus are inclusive.

##### Vaccines on the Transmission for Measles and Small Pox
Measles and small pox vaccines reduce the ongoing transmission if a vaccinated index case gets infected despite vaccination. E.g. for measles by about 40% as observed by [Cisse et al](#summary-cisse) and for small pox by about 30% as observed by [Mukherjee et al](#mukherjee). 

##### Vaccines on Shedding for Influenza A and B
Influenza A the vaccines do not to reduce viral shedding once symptomatically infected but even increase viral shedding as observed by [Yan et al](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#yan-2018). [Yan et al](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#yan-2018) also observe that for influenza B the shedding is the same regardless whether vaccinated.

##### School Setting
50% Group Size: Yes, Cleaning of Surface: Yes, Regular Ventilation: Yes, Hygiene: Yes, Face Mask in Break: Some, Face Mask in Classroom: No, Physical Distancing: Some, No Singing: Most, Physical Education: No

##### Results
* Infection by pupils
  1. Total of 557 Covid-19 cases in the age group 0-19 year out of a total of 3104 cases in Badenwuertenberg in the study period (19.5-25.7)
  2. For 453 School attendance information was available
  3. 137 (30% of 453) were at least 1 day at school while infectious 
  4. 11 other pupils were infected by 6 of those 137
  5. no secondary infection from those 11 were detected despite extensive contact tracing
* only 15 (3%) of 453 infected children (with school attendance known) were infected in schools (the 11 above from other pupils and 4 by teachers). Most infections occurred in families or festivals/events (Table 2).

##### Methods
Remark: Working Paper
* "Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions."
* the incidence rates were adjusted using logistic regression for wage, sex, occupation, educational attainment, income, regions of residence and of origin. OLS was used too. 

##### Results
* Comparison of Covid-19 incidences between parents with children in schools and homeschooling:
  * unadjusted the Covid incidence were near the same 5.67 versus 5.66 (Table 2)
  * adjusted the risk for parents with children in school was about 15% [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03–1.27] higher if adjusted with logistic regression(Table 1)
* "Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52–2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00–1.68]."

> ##### Comment
> It is not clear that the observed slightly increased Covid incidence of parents/teachers of lower secondary school children results from transmission from the children, it could also be attributed to parents visiting the schools and a transmission between adults.

##### Methods
Analyzing a large high school out break in Israel shortly after schools have been reopened. 

##### School Setting
* From 13 March to 17 May Schools in Israel were closed (limited opening for small children on 3 May)
* A heat wave with temperatures up to 40 degree from 19–21 May: 
  * "air-conditioning functioned continuously in all classes."
  * no face-masks
* "crowded classes: 35–38 students per class, class area 39–49 m2, allowing 1.1–1.3 m2 per student"

##### Results
* "Testing of the complete school community revealed 153 students (attack rate: 13.2%) and 25 staff members (attack rate: 16.6%) who were COVID-19 positive."
* "COVID-19 rates were higher in junior grades (7–9) than in high grades (10–12) (Figure 1). The peak rates were observed in the 9th grade (20 cases in one class and 13 cases in two other classes) and the 7th grade (14 cases in one class). Of the cases in teachers, four taught all these four classes, two taught three of the four classes and one taught two of these four classes."
* "Most student cases presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic."

PLoS Comput Biol 17(2): e1008559. <https://doi.org/ 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008559>
##### Methods
* "Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak (City close to Tel Aviv), Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR."
* The authors developed a model (discrete, stochastic and dynamic) for the propagation of Covid within a households. With this model infectivity and susceptibility of children and adults can be estimated and compared.
 
##### Findings
* "Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age."
* "We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63% (95% CI: [37%, 88%]) relative to that of adults."

> [Lumley March 21](#summary-lumley-march-21) is a continuation of this study.

##### Methods and Setting
"A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up."
##### Results
* 223 anti-spike–seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic.
* 2 anti-spike–seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both  asymptomatic.
* "After adjustment for age, gender, and month of testing (Table S1) or calendar time as a continuous variable (Fig. S2), the incidence rate ratio in seropositive workers was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.44; P = 0.002)."

Clinical Infectious Diseases.

##### Methods 
* Data Observation Duration: March 2020 to 28.2.2021
* Analyse the effect of seroconversion due to natural infection and vaccination on infection rates as part of the [OUCS testing](#testing-scheme-oucs).
* "Although an unexpected rise in incidence was seen in the first 2 weeks postvaccination, this time period was excluded from effectiveness calculations."

##### Settings
* "As previously reported [2], asymptomatic testing was less frequent in unvaccinated seropositive HCWs (127/10 000 person-days) than unvaccinated seronegative HCWs (185/10 000 person-days). Rates in previously seronegative and seropositive vaccinated staff were similar (163–169/10 000 person-days). Symptomatic testing followed a similar pattern (Supplementary Table 1)."
* "Most HCWs were vaccinated between December 2020 and January 2021 (Figure 1A); 8285 staff received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses)."

##### Results
###### Incidences Rates

Group |  case count | adjusted incidence ratio | 95% confidence interval
--|--|--|--
seronegative HCWs | 635 | ref | -
unvaccinated seropositive HCWs |12 | 0.15 | .08–.26 
seronegative, 1 dose vaccine vaccination | 64|0.36 | .26–.50
second vaccination | 2 | ~ 0.10 | .02–.38 (large interval since only 2 cases)

Comments:
* Very low person count for double vaccinated, thus the result has a large confidence interval.
* An increased infection risk in the first 2 weeks after vaccination especially for AstraZeneca
  > This can be due to behavior changes but in theory also biological mechanisms are thinkable e.g. vaccines can (temporarily) diminish the immune system by killing immune cells or the immune system is distracted: it builds up a strong immune protection against the vaccine and thereby temporarily ignores the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
* From two weeks on after the first vaccine dose the rate of PCR positivity was reduce by about 65% (as described in incidence rates). The reduction was similar for BT162 and AstraZeneca. (Figure 3 )

[todo add figure 3]

###### Viral Load
* *By Symptom Status:* The median viral loads were higher, that is, lower Ct values lower in symptomatic infections (median [IQR] Ct: 16.3 [IQR 13.5–21.7]) compared to asymptomatic infections (Ct: 20 [IQR 14.5–29.5]) (Figure 4A, Kruskal-Wallis P < .001)." // since many asymptomatic individuals had low viral loads but high viral loads were observed in both groups.
* *By Immune Status:* "Unvaccinated seronegative HCWs had the highest viral loads (Ct: 18.3 [IQR 14.0–25.5]), followed by vaccinated previously seronegative HCWs (Ct: 19.7 [IQR 15.0–27.5]); unvaccinated seropositive HCWs had the lowest viral loads (Ct: 27.2 [IQR 18.8–32.2]) (Figure 4B, overall P = .06)." // only few cases of unvaccinated seropositive

February; 94% BNT162b2

##### Results

Immune Status| # PCR positives | Incidence per 10 K person days | Reduction to sero -
--|--|--|--
sero - | 902 | 20 | ref
sero + |  75 |  3 |  85 % (*)

(\*) Comment: The reductions given above are unadjusted (in the paper adjustments are done). Adjustments are tricky e.g. [Illingworth et al](#summary-illingworth) observe the majority of transmissions in *non* Covid wards. Adjustment for month would be important since in December and January there were many more cases than in February (e.g. observed in [Lumley](#summary-lumley-march-21)) and double vaccinated persons were mainly followed from mid January onwards. Further considerations in [Analyzing Incidence Rates](#analyzing-incidence-rates-and-upon-exposure).


### Refs Household Transmissions

#### Notes on Household Transmissions
Even if the Covid prevalence is low, infected household members may community acquire the infection at the same event since the transmission is super-spreading-event driven and the disease onset can be hard to determine due to asymptomatic/low symptomatic cases and varying incubation times. Methods such as sensitivity analyses with varying the cut-off dates between symptom onsets can sometimes increase the confidence in the model used. If the community transmissions are high, the secondary attack rates needs correction for community acquired infections. Also commented at [Summary Madewell](#summary-madewell)].

<https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164590>, posted August 1, 2020.

##### Methods
Meta-Analysis of studies regarding the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in household settings. Many different kind of studies are included: 
* Covid diagnosis based on live tests (RT-PCR) or past infections with antibody tests, some studies included symptoms, a few studies do whole-genome sequencing, some studies are in settings (area and times) of high prevalence.
* The influence of the different factors (contact type, symptom status, adult/child contacts, sex, relationship to index case, number of contacts in household, ...) is analyzed.

##### Comment
> Studies from countries with high and very high Covid prevalence are included too, in these countries independent infections pathways for different household members are very likely and thus inferring the secondary attack rate from the prevalence in household members overestimates the secondary attack rate. 

##### Findings
Secondary Attack Rates with different groups as **infectors**. The error rate is in brackets. 
* household: 0.19 (0.4); family including non household contacts: 0.18 (0.5)
* symptomatic: 0.2 (0.6); pre- or asymptomatic: 0.07 (0.04)

Secondary Attack Rates with different groups as **infectees**. The error rate is in brackets. 
* children: 0.16 (0.6); adults: 0.31 (1.2) // adults includes spouses
* spouse: 0.43 (1.6); other: 1.8 (0.8)

Proportion of households where a secondary transmission was observed:
* 0.32 (.025)

Comparison with SARS-1 or MERS:
* SARS-1: 0.06 (0.04)
* MERS: 0.035 (0.035)

Upon illness, nasal and throat swabs were taken and tested human coronaviruses (HCoV) types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. The participant were interviewed for the illness.
##### Results
* CoV were the causes of ARIs in about 10 to 15%.
* The secondary attack rate is about 10%.
* The incubation period is about 3 days.

([Supplement to Harris](#summary-harris))
* Institutional settings (using UPRN information) such as care homes, prisons, and households with more than 10 residents are excluded.
* "HOSTED includes individual-level socio-demographic data for cases and household contacts, including age, sex, and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD); information on property type, confirmed cases using PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 through national reporting systems, and linked information on hospitalisation and mortality. The vaccination data include date and type (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2) of first and second doses for all vaccinated individuals in the HOSTED dataset." (Supplement to [Harris](#summary-harris)).

International Journal of Epidemiology, Volume 50, Issue 3, June 2021, Pages 743–752, 
<https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab057>

##### Methods
* The [Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset (HOSTED)](#hosted) links confirmed COVID-19 cases to individuals in the same household in England.
* "We explored the risk of household transmission according to: age of case and contact, sex, region, deprivation, month and household composition between April and September 2020, building a multivariate model."

##### Results
The heat map (Figure 3 in the paper and displayed in the section [transmission by age](#transmission-by-age)) shows the secondary cases by age of the index case and age of the contact. The figure shows:

* _Few Spread:_ People younger than 30 year but older than 4 have few secondary cases (left third of the image except left most column).
* _Much Spread:_ 
  * For index cases above 40 years the transmissions are high. The transmission rates peak at an age of about 65 years.
  * Very young children 0 to 4 of age transmit Covid well and mainly to their parents and their grand parents (left most column).
  * Parents between 40 and 59 transmit to older children (15-24) but the children not to them (hotspot at middle right, missing hotspot on the mirrored)

The graphs below show the secondary attack rate in the different administration division in the UK from June to early September 2020: 
![Transmission by regions](images/hall_secondary_cases_by_region.jpg)

The Southern regions have lower secondary attack rates likely due to the more comfortable climate in the summer months.

##### Methods Details
"As the incubation period for SAR-CoV-2 is thought to be 2–14 days [16],  we chose a threshold of 2 days between the specimen dates of the index and secondary cases as a pragmatic decision to offset the risks of misclassifying cases as either co-primary or as secondary. A sensitivity analysis using a cut-off of 4 days found to have little effect on any of the results or on the multivariable model. We have also made the implicit assumption that two (or more) cases occurring in a household within 2–14 days represents household transmission when it also plausible that they are two independent community-acquired infections. However, given the timing of this study, when the number of cases was at its lowest, this risk is probably small." 

> // Simultaneous community acquired infection (e.g. at a super spreading event) cannot be ruled out even with the sensitivity analysis by varying the incubation cut-offs taking into account quite frequent asymptomatic/low symptomatic cases.

##### Methods
* "The analysis cohort included households with an index case occurring between 4th January 2021 to 28th February 2021, with 14 days observable follow up for all contacts."
* "We defined Index Cases as the earliest case of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, by diagnosis date, for a household. Household Contacts were defined as all individuals with the same address as the index cases of COVID-19; and Secondary Cases as a known household contact of an index case with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test that has a specimen date between two and 14 days after the specimen date of the index case."
* "The analysis cohort included households with an index case occurring between 4th January 2021 to 28th February 2021, with 14 days observable follow up for all contacts."
* "In all households, the majority of index cases and contacts were age <60, with a high proportion of individuals aged <40 in unvaccinated households."

1. *Index Non vaccinated:* household attack rate is 10.1%: unvaccinated index cases induced 96,898 secondary cases out of 960,765 household contacts.
2. *Index vaccinated (21 days after first dose):* household attack rate is roughly 6%: Index vaccinated with 1 dose ChAdOx1 induced 196 secondary cases in 3,424 contacts (5.72%). Index case 1 dose BNT162b2 induced 371 secondary cases in 5,939 contacts (6.25%). // not much difference between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 this despite BNT162b2 initially offers a higher protection against infection. 
3. *Index and (some) contact vaccinated:* The secondary attack rate when both the index case and the contacts are vaccinated seems to be not much different as when both are unvaccinated: Secondary attack rate when both index and contact are vaccinated: 8152 out of 67622 contacts (Table S1) > SAR ~= 12%. The 12% SAR is about 60% of the attack rates of 19.6% observed between older couples (Table S4). Since vaccinated contact are less likely to get infected (though not necessarily all are vaccinated), this observation indicates no or only a slightly reduced transmission from vaccinated persons to other vaccinated persons once positive tested. // This calculation does not take days since vaccination into account (in the first 2 weeks after vaccination the infectivity seems to be stable for ChAdOx1 respectively to increase for BNT162b2 (Figure 2)).

=> The effect of vaccination on infectiousness is not quite clear. Comparing 1. and 2. indicates a reduced infectiousness by about 40%. However this could be influence by the decreasing incidence rates from January to February. The observations if both index cases and at least one contact is vaccinated in 3. indicates no much not much effect of vaccination on transmission if positively tested.

##### Comments
> *Adjustments:* For the difficulties regarding correct adjustment, unadjusted data are stated above. This since adjusting is tricky: e.g. for older couples which belong to vaccine-prioritized groups, the secondary attack is higher, however in the weeks before a vaccination appointment the infection rate decreases in the UK as observed in [Pritchard](#summary-pritchard), and the latter is more likely in older couples (possibly due to increased care). 

> *Biases:* Vaccinated persons may be miss-classified as contacts since they are less likely symptomatic in the first month after vaccinations due to vaccine effectiveness at preventing symptomatic disease, placebo effects and the protection from severe disease. Which could yield to a bias in households with many infectees: the index case can be wrongly attributed to an unvaccinated person. Considering only households where both index and contact are vaccinated is less biased in this respect, as noted in 3., this data indicates no reduced transmission of vaccinated index cases.


### Refs ONS-CIS Analyses
Households are visited and instructed how to self take nose and throat swabs. The household are visited weekly in the first month and then monthly for the first year. The swabs are sent or colleted and analyzed in labs for PCR testing. The goal overview of the community prevalence. From a random 10-20% of households, those 16 years or older were invited to participate in monthly antibody testing.

##### Goal
"Here we seek to calculate a total effect of having at least one completed vaccination in a household before introduction of infection, with no attempt to determine causation, mediation, confounding etc. We quantify uncertainty in the results using bootstrapping."

##### Method Details
* "For visits to be included in the current dataset, participants had to be aged 16 years or over and have either a positive or negative swab result from 1st December 2020 to 31 May 2021."
* "We did not differentiate between vaccines since our aim is to obtain a total effect of the programme as implemented."

##### Results
* Households without vaccination: SAR = 23.5 [22.6,24.4]%
* Households with a least one vaccination 21 days before: SAR = 12.5 [4.0,23.3]% //the vaccination can either be the index, any contact, or all/both

##### Methods
* 1,945,071 Covid PCR tests from nose and throat swabs taken from 383,812 [ONS-CIS](#ons-cis) participants between 1 December 2020 and 8 May 2021 are analyzed to assess the effects of vaccination and previous infections.
* Vaccines used are nearly exclusively BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1
##### Results
* Fig. 1 a: The vaccines reduce number of samples with very high viral loads. Natural infection does so even better.
* Fig. 2 d: The two dose vaccines and natural infection reduce the chance for a positive test for B117 by about 80 %.
* Fig. 3b: 
  * BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 show a very similar effectiveness at reducing the odds for a viral load Ct<40 and Ct<30. //follow up analysis ([Pouwels](#summary-pouwels)) reveals that BNT162b2 has a higher initial effectiveness but then decreases faster. The similar effectiveness obtained here, could be due to earlier vaccinations with BNT162b2 and so the time spans since vaccination were longer.
  * The odds of a viral loads Ct<30 are more reduced compared to Ct<40 more compared to unvaccinated persons: The odds start to decrease about one week after the first dose, are further reduce 21 days after the first dose and reach a reduction of about 0.3 for Ct<40 and a reduction of about 0.15 for Ct<30.

##### Methods
ONS-CIS data is analysed for the periods 1 Dec 2020 – 16 May 2021 (Alpha) and 17 May 2021- 1 August 2021 (Delta)

##### Method Details
"During the Alpha-dominant period from 1 December 2020 to 16 May 2021 (Figure S1), nose and throat RT- PCR results were obtained from 384,543 individuals aged 18 years or older (221,909 households) at 2,580,021 visits (median [IQR] 7 [6-8]), of which 16,538 (0.6%) were the first PCR-positive in a new infection episode. During the Delta-dominant period from 17 May to 1 August 2021, results were obtained from 358,983 individuals (213,825 households) at 811,624 visits (median [IQR] 2 [2-3]), 3,123 (0.4%) being the first PCR-positive. Characteristics at included visits are shown in Table S1."

##### Results
"From 14 June 2021, after which >92% of PCR-positives with Ct<30 were Delta-compatible (Figure S1), differences in Ct values between those unvaccinated (median (IQR) 25.7 (19.1-30.8) [N=326]) and ≥14 days after second vaccination (25.3 (19.1-31.3) [N=1593]) had attenuated substantially (age/sex-adjusted p=0.35, heterogeneity versus Alpha-dominant period p=0.01), as had differences with those unvaccinated but previously PCR/antibody-positive (22.3 (16.5-30.3) [N=20])." 

##### Comment on Pouwels
> The results obtained partly fail the [Bias Tests](#testing-for-biases): E.g. the protection from natural infection was about 10% higher for roughly one month earlier data period end ([Pritchard](#summary-pritchard))[todo: confirm and add values in results]. Also sometime the protection against Ct<40 is higher than the protection <30 thus the results should be considered with care. The seasonal and measure induced incidence shift of Covid in the UK combined with shifting immune status on visits (extended Data Fig. 3 | Proportion of visits by exposure.) may be a reason.

##### Findings
###### Vaccinated Contacts
"The SAR in household contacts exposed to the delta variant was 25% (95% CI 18–33) for fully vaccinated individuals compared with 38% (24–53) in unvaccinated individuals."
* "The median time between second vaccine dose and study recruitment in fully vaccinated contacts was longer for infected individuals (median 101 days [IQR 74–120]) than for uninfected individuals (64 days [32–97], p=0·001)."
* "We estimated vaccine effectiveness at preventing infection (regardless of symptoms) with delta in the household setting to be 34% (bootstrap 95% CI –15 to 60)."

###### Vaccinated Index
"The SAR in household contacts exposed to fully vaccinated index cases was 25% (95% CI 15–35; 17 of 69), which is similar to the SAR in household contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases (23% [15–31]; 23 of 100; table 2)."

###### Viral Loads
* "Although peak viral load did not differ by vaccination status or variant type, it increased modestly with age (difference of 0·39 [95% credible interval –0·03 to 0·79] in peak log10 viral load per mL between those aged 10 years and
50 years)."
* "Fully vaccinated individuals with delta variant infection had a faster (posterior probability >0·84) mean rate of
viral load decline (0·95 log copies per mL per day) than did unvaccinated individuals with pre-alpha (0·69), alpha (0·82), 10
or delta (0·79) variant infections."

Adam D, Wu P, Wong J, et al. Research Square; 2020. 
<https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-29548/v1>

##### Methods
"Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection."

##### Results
* Distribution of Infectivity:
  * 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
  * 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
  * 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in quarantine, Fig.2)
* "Gatherings in social settings such as bars, restaurants, weddings and religious sites appear to be at increased risk of superspreading events."
* "Transmission in social settings was significantly associated with an increased number of secondary cases compared to transmission observed in family households."
* Quarantine
  * Home quarantine yielded sporadic infections (2 observed) in family settings (Fig.2 d) and none outside families
  * Government quarantine yielded no further infections (Fig.2)
* "Of all cases confirmed in Hong Kong, 195 (18.8%, 195/1,038) were asymptomatic at confirmation (Supplementary Table 2) and, of these, most (83.1%, 162/195) were PCR-confirmed from 27 March onward". So ahead of 27 March asymptomatic cases were sporadic and less than 5%. From 27 March onwards asymptomatic cases jumped to around 40 % (Extended Data Fig.2).
* Infections caused by pre-symptomatic infectors were rarely observed: "Seven instances of likely pre-symptomatic transmission were observed where onset of the infectee preceded that of the infector or occurred on the same day."

##### Limitations
"These findings take advantage of the quality of case ascertainment and contact tracing data in Hong Kong, although some incompleteness in links between cases could potentially bias our estimates of transmission heterogeneity."

<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19248-0>

##### Methods
212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences in combination with "high-resolution epidemiological data" are used to deduce the spread into and within Israel.

##### Results
* "We find that travelers returning from the United States of America significantly contributed to viral spread in Israel, more than their proportion in incoming infected travelers."
* "We further report high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 2-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections."
  * "Specifically, if we assume almost complete case reporting, our phylodynamic analysis indicates that between 5% and 10% of infections are responsible for 80% of secondary infections. With lower assumed levels of case reporting, less than 5% of infections would be responsible for 80% of secondary infections." // considering that SARS-CoV-2 tests have a detection rate of about 50% and many cases are missed by contact tracing, an upper bound of 1/3 for the case reporting seem reasonable in the Spring 2020 in Israel => the model predicts that about 2% are responsible for 80% of the infections (p_h = 0.02 in Fig 6)

##### Conclusions
* "Our results indicate that superspreading events drive the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that focused measures to reduce contacts of select individuals/social events could mitigate viral spread."
* The global connectivity allows for massive introductions which suggests the importance of border controls. //The authors als conclude shelter-in-place restriction for halting viral spread but as of July 2021 it is known that shelter-in-place likely increases and not decreases the spread due to indoor aerosol transmissions.
##### Method Details
* "We obtained RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal samples. Sequencing was performed based on the V3 Artic protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019)."
* "Instead of assuming a given level of transmission heterogeneity for Israel, we instead performed phylodynamic inference for the SEIR model across a range of transmission heterogeneities. Specifically, the SEIR-type model implemented two classes of infectious individuals, corresponding to a highly infectious subset of individuals (Ih) and a less
infectious subset of individuals (Il)." // Detail description in Methods>Phylodynamic analysis> Equation (1) - (5).

##### Methods
Using an algorithm based both on contacts patterns between people and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes Illingworth et al infer patterns of viral transmission between patients and health care workers (HCWs).

##### Results
* "Of the 38 transmission events in the maximum likelihood networks, 20 were patient-to-patient, 8 were from patient to HCW, 8 were HCW-to-HCW, and just 2 were from HCW to patient (Figure 2—figure supplement 1)"
* Most patient transmission occurred in non Covid wards (Figure 2 for non Covid wards versus Figure 3 for Covid wards). //this indicates that protection measures in Covid wards work(ed)

Errata in the article: The study of [Pouwels et al](#summary-pouwels) is analysed and it is argued that the vaccine completely lost efficacy in preventing infection. Which is not true (and the calculations by Pouwels et al are correct) since 1) the study population has a high vaccine coverage and only adults over 18 are considered and 2) the vaccine status is  considered per visit. The latter has its own challenges/caveats though (see [Summary Pouwels](#summary-pouwels) and Table S2 in Pouwels for visit counts by immune status).

##### Methods
Analyse the effect of BNT162b2 regarding SARS-Cov-2 infections in health care workers with a prospective cohort study from 19.12.20 to 14.3.21.

##### Methods Details
* "The study took place at the Sheba Medical Center, the largest tertiary medical center in Israel, with 1400 acute care beds and 200 rehabilitation beds, from December 19, 2020, when vaccine rollout began, until March 14, 2021. All HCW were allowed and encouraged to receive the vaccine, without any prioritization, except that initially those with previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were not eligible. During this period, a third surge of COVID-19 took place in Israel, peaking on January 14, 2021, with 8,424 daily detected cases (7- day moving average)."
* "On each day, we considered individuals to have a status of being either Unvaccinated, in the Early Vaccine stage (defined as 4 to 10 days post the first dose), those Partially Vaccinated (11 days post first dose to 10 days post second dose), or Fully Vaccinated (11 days or more post second dose)."
* " Staff could transition from one group to another following seroconversion or vaccination after 60 or 14 days, respectively, disregarding any PCR-positive result during this crossover period, including the 14 days following a second vaccination for previously seronega- tive HCWs vaccinated twice."

##### Results
"Among those exposed, 295 individuals (8.2%) had a positive result. N-gene Ct value was available for 224 (75.9%) cases."

###### Vaccine Effects upon Exposure
Testing after exposure regardless of vaccination status. The table below shows the results (adapted from Table 2a in the paper):

Status | # Exposures | # PCR Ct <40 | Prev Ct <40 | Prev Ct <30 | Prev never Symptoms | Prev Symptom & <30 | RR PCR<40 | reduction Ct<40 | reduction Ct<30
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--
unvacc     | 1441 | 75 | 5.2 % | 3.1 % | 3.3 % | 1.8 % | 1 (ref) | 0 % (ref) | 0 % (ref)
early vacc | 490  | 18 | 3.7 % | 1.7 % | 2.4 % | 1.0 % | .71 | 29 % | 45 %
part. vacc | 1442 | 34 | 2.4 % | 1.2 % | 1.5 % | 0.6 % | .45 | 55 % | 59 %
fully vacc | 1300 | 23 | 1.8 % | 0.9 % | 0.9 % | 0.3 % | .34 | 66 % | 70 %

> In the paper positive is written instead of Ct < 40

> => vaccine efficacy is about 70 % for high viral loads (less 30 cycles) and about 66 % for a detectable viral load (<40 cycles) for BNT162b2 from two weeks to 2 months after vaccination.

###### Vaccine Effects by Incidence Rates
All tests: Those after exposure as above but also all infections detected by other tests (which likely are likely less for vaccinated e.g. indicated by comparing the larger case count for unvaccinated periods when going from exposures to incidence). 

Status | # cases Ct<40 | Rate per Person days | reduction Ct<40 (prevalence adjusted) | reduction  Ct<40 and symptomatic| reduction Ct<30 and symptomatic
--|--|--|--|--|--
unvacc     | 163 | 8.2 | 0 % (ref) | 0 % (ref) |  0 % (ref)
early vacc |  42 | 7.8 | 13 % | 21 %| 23 %
partly vacc|  50 | 3.0 | 75 % | 80 %| 80 %
fully vacc |  31 | 0.9 | 88 % | 90 %| 88 %

> The vaccine effects by exposure and incidence rates are further discussed in the section [On Incidence vs on Exposure](#analyzing-incidence-rates-and-upon-exposure) where the above data serve as example and are interpreted.

##### Methods
* *Type:* Retrospective cohort study based on case matching using the data from MHS health fund. 
* *Population:* The study population included MHS members aged 16 or older." //the different cohorts are described under models in the result section below
* *Diagnosis:* RT-PCR test and symptoms in the next 5 days (chiefly fever, cough, breathing difficulties, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, myalgia, weakness, headache and sore throat.)
* *Dependent Variables:* "Outcomes, or second events: documented RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. Outcomes were evaluated during the follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, the date of analysis, corresponding to the time in which the Delta variant became dominant in Israel."

##### Results
Three different comparison denoted as Model 1 (infected in early 2020 compared to vaccinated in early 2020), Model 2 (anytime infected compared to vaccinated in early 2020) and Model 3 (infected compared to infected and additionally vaccinated) are made. 

The odds ratios below are adjusted for comorbidities and market with (*).

###### Model 1
Comparison of vaccinated persons (second dose between 1.1. and 28.2.21) to persons infected (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test between 1.1. and 28.2.21). A total of 16215 persons were in both groups.

Outcome  |  outcome in vaccinated | outcome in recovered  | odds ratio (*) | 95% confidence (*)
--|--|--|--|--
Positive PCR  | 238 | 19 | 13.06 | [8.08, 21.11]
Symptomatic Inf.  | 191 | 8 | 27.02 | [12.7, 57.5]
Hospitalization  | 8 | 1 | ~ 8 | too few cases

###### Model 2
Comparison of vaccinated persons to infected any time before. Each of the two groups contained 46035 persons. 
Notes
* The difference to model 1 is that the natural infection was allowed to occur *any time* before 28.2.21. Most infections happened in September 2020, thus the natural infections occurred on average before the vaccination. The study population is more than 3 times as large.
* To check whether the Covid pass from natural infection was valid throughout the entire study period. //else the results could be "Covid certificate" biased, which could for example induce an overestimation of the vaccine efficacy compared to natural infection.

Hospitalization  | 21 | 4 | 6.7 | [1.99, 22.56]

###### Model 3
Comparison of immunity by natural infection alone and infection followed by vaccination (between March and 25.5.21). // the vaccination occurred right before the study period, thus this model 3 describes primarily whether an additional vaccine has an effect on reinfection in the first few months.

*Pattern of intrafamilial transmission of smallpox in Calcutta, India.* 
Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 51(3), 219.

##### Methods and Setting
* The household transmission of 43 smallpox cases which occurred in Calcutta in  1971 and 1972 is analysed.
* "The areas affected by smallpox were generally slum areas where the houses consisted of compounds or open spaces surrounded by 5-7 rooms, each living room being occupied by a " family" (multiple family compound). Very rarely, a family had more than 1 room or a separate compound (single family compound). The members of all the families in each compound mixed freely amongst themselves."

##### Findings

* Vaccinated persons are less likely to get infected (Table B), if infected less likely to be severely ill (Table A shows that the majority of index cases wasn't pox vaccinated and in agreement Table B and C show that vaccinated persons have a much lower risk to get infected. Table A indicates that the share of severe cases is much higher among unvaccinated persons). 
* Vaccinated persons transmit smallpox less since less likely to get ill and if ill they transmit less since fewer severe cases (Table A) which transmit more (Table B) and even with the same symptom level vaccinated persons transmit less (Table C)
* The secondary attack rates (SAR) in household settings is up to 90 % between unvaccinated individuals and decreases to about 5 % between vaccinated individuals (Table C). 
* The effect of vaccination is primarily by reducing susceptibility, by about a factor 10 i.e. 90% reduction; some reduction of transmissibility of vaccinated index cases seems to occur but it is comparatively low, about a factor 1.5 to 2 i.e. 30% to 50% reduction  (Table C).

###### Corrections Table 7
> Some of the data in Table 7. in the paper are not consistent with Table 4. and Table 1. and additionally the data in Table 7. are partly unlikely/wrong. Therefore some of the data in Table 7. and accordingly in the table P-B above, have  corrections by "educated guessing" to make the data consistent. No inconsistencies for other data has been observed, but not all tables have been crosschecked. <!--The paper is pretty old, I consider to reach the authors nevertheless.-->

##### Methods
Analyses of a measles outbreak in Detroit in 1935. Families with measles cases and susceptible contacts were randomly contacted and the household transmission rates analysed.

##### Findings
* The household attack rate of measles among susceptible contacts (not having had measles before) is about 85 % (Table 1).
* Index cases aged between 5 and 9 are most infectious with about 88 % infected contacts compared to index cases between 1 and 4 which infect 73 % and index cases between 10 and 14 which infect about 70 % of susceptible contacts (Table 1 or Table 2).
* Children between 1 and 4 are most susceptible and get infected with a probability above 90 % compared to about 50 % for children below 1 and about 80 % for children between 5 and 9 (Table 3 or Table 2).
* The household attack rates and the case numbers are highest in the winter months. Nearly no cases were observed in the summer months (Table 4).

##### Methods
"Patterns of measles transmission at school and at home were studied in 1995 in a rural area of Senegal with a high level of vaccination coverage."

##### Setting Measles Senegal

Age Group (years) | Vaccination | Children with history of measles | Total Immune Primed
--|--|--|--
1-4 years | 80 % | 3 % | 83 %
5-9 years | 68 % | 10 % | 78 %
10 - 14 years | 36 % | 39 % | 75 %

#### Findings
* Attack rates are about 50% for unvaccinated children in households/huts and about 20% in compounds regardless of age group (Table 2.) // surprising since in the older age groups previous measles infection are more prevalent ([Setting](#setting-measles-senegal)) and a previous infection provides near complete immunity [to cite]. The equal attack rates combined with increased seroprevalence at higher age, indicates that the susceptibility tends to increase with age.
* Attack rates for vaccinated children were about 10 % across all settings and age groups. (Table 2) // thus the vaccine reduce the susceptibility by 80 %
* Unvaccinated index cases yield about 1.5 to 2 times more secondary cases (Table 3).
* A measles infection was not associated to a change in school grades.

##### Methods

##### Setting
* "Vaccination was given as post-exposure prophylaxis, but also to individuals in the society who were uncertain of their vaccination history." 

##### Findings
* The spread was superspreader driven with 4 cases with onward transmission, all index cases not vaccinated. Of 27 onwards transmissions, a total of 24 (11 + 13) were caused by two patient with a NPS viral loads of 17 and 18. The transmission chains visualized (shown is Figure 2 from the paper):

* 16 of 28 measles infections were vaccine breakthroughs (some 1 and some 2 doses) and 12 naive infections. This despite an estimated vaccine coverage > 95 %;in  2007 seroprevalence investigation, antibodies were detected in >98% participants (Introduction section in the paper). Thus the vaccine seems to efficiently reduce detectable infections. 

* Viral loads from vaccinated cases were much lower than than those of unvaccinated cases (shown is Figure 4 from the paper)

* "In addition, six confirmed vaccine infections were diagnosed in adult patients, who all received their first dose of measles vaccine during or directly after the outbreak (Table 3)."



## Appendix


### Analyzing Incidence Rates and Upon Exposure
Incidence rates are used by a many studies to analyze the protection provided by vaccines or previous infections. However incidence analyses are tricky:

#### Supposedly Safe Effect
"The Supposedly Safe Effect" is used here to denote behavior changes if supposedly infection free. E.g. once vaccinated many people and public authorities think that testing is not necessary any more and thus testing is reduced. When not accounting for the test positivity rate, this can yield an underestimation of the true prevalence of infectees.

#### Shifting Incidence Effect
"The Shifting Incidence Effect" is used here to denote that the prevalence of (detectable) SARS-CoV-2 infections varies through time e.g. the rates are often higher in settings with dry air (heated or air-conditioned). When analyzing the effectiveness of interventions (e.g. vaccination) with incidence rates, the prevalence changes need to be taken into account: E.g. when most people are unvaccinated during times with high SARS-2 prevalence and later most people are vaccinated during a time with low SARS-2 prevalence (e.g. due to seasonal effects or other interventions), the vaccine effectiveness is overestimated.

##### Testing for Biases
* Taking into account the test positivity rate. // for safe and shift effects
* Viral Load: For most protection methods (including increased immune protection) a shift of the viral load distribution (over location&time or over populations) a shift towards lower viral loads is expected if the the protection works ([Relation between Viral Load Distribution and Positivity](#relation-between-viral-load-distribution-and-positivity-rate)). If just two cutoff viral loads are taken: High viral loads are excepted to be reduced more than low viral loads e.g. a greater reduction of samples with Ct<30 (high viral loads) than of samples with Ct<40 is expected. // for safe effects and shift effects
* Sensitivity Analyzes: sub samples e.g. varying the time period. // varying the time period is ideal to detect shift effects.
* Look for Jumps: E.g. the vaccines effectiveness increase and decrease linearly ([Vaccine Time Varying Effects](#vaccine-time-varying-effects)). If there is a sudden jump in efficacy e.g. right after the 2nd dose then this is likely due to be safe effects e.g. testing is no longer recommended/required (by authorities).

#### Example Analysis from Israel
The excellent investigation by [Regev-Yochay et al](#summary-regev-yochay) does both an analysis upon exposure and an incidence rate analysis for the efficacy of BNT162b2. The observed differences between vaccine protection determined by exposure and by incidence show exemplary crucial points on effectiveness analyses:
* The results obtained by exposure based testing are consistent with the observed viral load shift by the different vaccination stages. On the other hand the results from the incidence rates have sudden jumps and don't agree with a continuos viral load shift. 
* The results obtained by upon exposure analysis yield for all vaccine stages a higher protection against high viral loads. For the incidence analysis this is not observed anymore for fully vaccinated persons.

Possible why the incidence analyses does less well in the bias tests:
* Israel introduced a "Covid Pass" called "Green Pass" which requires vaccination, recent overcome infection or testing to enter certain places. Thus, those not vaccinated likely do much more community tests than those vaccinated. This increases the detection rate for unvaccinated (especially mild cases) and so vaccine effectiveness based on incidence is overestimated.
* The study took place from mid December to mid March. During this period there was a Covid wave peaking at mid January and a vaccination campaign where the majority of workers get vaccinated by the first dose in late December and with the second dose in mid January (Fig 1 in the paper). Thus most days for the incidence observation for fully vaccinated cases (10 days post second dose) are after the wave peak when the Covid prevalence was much lower (the decline was mostly not due to vaccination since the vaccine effects across the majority of the population were not there yet in mid January). 

In conclusion analyses and detecting biases can be tricky.
