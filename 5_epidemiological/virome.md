# The Virome with a Focus on Coronaviruses in Health and Disease

## Summary


## Introduction
Life form interactions are ubiquitous on earth. Some interactions are lineage permanent (i.e. stable across generations), some lifetime permanent and some vary. The mitochondria in eukaryotic cells is an example of a permanent coupling. An other permanent coupling are the retroviruses integrated inside the genome of eukaryotes. 
The microbiome of multicellular organisms is a tight interactions but the life forms are not necessarily permanently coupled. Tough the transition from infections with permanent coupling to loose coupling is continuous: Many plant viruses are transmitted vertically (from one generation to the next generation) and also in the case of animals vertical transmission is prevalent e.g. herpes viruses are viruses that can be transmitted vertically. In the case of bacteria the coupling is not that tight and they kept the ability to live outside of multicellular hosts, the hosts on the other hand need bacteria (e.g. for proper digestion) but the bacteria are often replaceable. Generally the outer surfaces of multicellular organism are inhabited by bacteria and viruses and are part of the microbiome. Special locations of multicellular organisms are the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract which are surfaces on the outside (i.e. these surface can be reached without breaching a cell layer) but are inside when considering the 3 dimension structure. In the central parts the membranes are quite permeable and the nutrients respectively the gas exchange takes place. For most parts these surfaces are covered with protecting mucus and thus they are called mucosal surfaces. These surfaces provide a habitat for a variety of microorganisms. This microorganism form the mucosal microbiome. The mucosal microbiome consists of different life forms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. Positive stranded RNA viruses such as coronaviruses or rhinoviruses are part of the respiratory tract virome.

## Detecting and Measuring Virus Infections
To compare coronavirus infections, one needs to specify how and where to measure them. 
* Coronavirus infections can be diagnosed by different methods (e.g. PCR, culture or antigen tests)
* Coronaviruses infect different part throughout the respiratory tract. To some extent the virions get distributed and thus a very high viral load in one location likely can be detected in other parts to. Nevertheless the viral loads differ for the different locations.

Nearly all methods are geared towards detecting diseases: Symptom detection or detection of tissue damage nearly exclusively work if there is a disease. 
To investigate the virome in the healthy state is difficult since 1) there's usually no (visible) tissue change, 2) the viral load is usually low and 3) the immune response very subtle. PCR tests can be used, however taken into account their limitations for the detection of low viral loads. At viral loads below 10^5 virions/milliliter the PCR sensitivity starts to decrease. In Ct values this corresponds to more than 35 cycles for most apparatuses. Even at the location of infection in healthy state persistent infections the viral load is mostly below 10^4 virions per milliliter of respiratory tract fluid.

Diagnosis with a focus on the diagnosis of the Covid-19 disease is discussed in the chapter ([Chapter Diagnosis and Viral Load](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md)).


## Viral Load and Transmissibility
How many virions are at the different locations in the respiratory tract and how much particulates are exhaled from each location determine the amount of virions exhaled. The virus exhaled are mostly from the conducting airways or the lungs but not from the nose. 

`Infectiousness = amount of exhaled particles * viral at the source of the particles`

The correlation between exhaled aerosol in the viral load in the nose is fairly weak as shown by [Malik et al]

* The correlation viral load in the nose does not strongly correlate with amount of exhaled infectious aerosol as shown for influenza by [Yan et al](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#summary-yan-2018)). Also it is observed that vaccination the amount of exhaled infectious aerosol for symptomatic influenza A infections.
* Correctly sampled saliva or sputum predict the disease progression, which likely corresponds to the viral load in the lower airways.


## Coronavirus Viral Load Ranges and Significance

Amount | #virions per ml | ~ Ct Value | Significance 
--|--|--|--
'Very Few'| < 100 | > 40 | This viral load is mostly not detected. Whether healthy people can be persistently infected with such low viral loads is possible but hardly investigated. Such infections are not clinically relevant but may have an epidemiological relevance since the viruses evolve.// As of October 2020 nearly nothing is published about viral loads beyond 40 for any coronavirus.
'Few' | 1000 | 35 | Mostly asymptomatic. Sometimes people are persistently infected with such intermediate viral loads. The risk for such infections is higher in immunocompromised and there is also evidence that the currently prevalent muscular administrated vaccines (specifically observed for the 'mRNA' vaccine BNT162b2) sometimes yield incomplete immune responses which enable persistent infection with such viral loads [to cite].
'Intermediate' | 10^6 | 25 | With a million virions per milliliter, there are usually symptoms i.e. there is a disease. 
'High' | 10^9 | 15 | With a billion of viruses per milliliter (!) one is usually severely sick.


Comments:
* The relation between the virions number and the Ct value depends on the exact PCR method including the primer(s) used.
* The above values are the viral load in the upper respiratory tract samples. In the upper respiratory tract the viral load is highly variable.
* In the lower respiratory tract fluids the viral load tends to be more stable than in the URT. In the lower respiratory tract already a viral load above 10^6 virions per milliliter is a severe disease and may cause pneumonia and require hospitalization.
