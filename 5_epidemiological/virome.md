## Summary
Multicellular organisms are permanently or temporarily inhabited by a variety of microorganisms. Mostly these microorganisms are beneficial. However the microbiome can become out of balance and a certain type replicates to high numbers, this microorganisms can have harmful effects.
Normally the immune system controls the microbiome and many species of the microbiome are below the detection limit of common diagnosis methods such as PCR. The microbiome is subject to fluctuations during lifetime. When the immune system diminished and/or at high age, the immune system may fail at controlling new microorganism arriving and the infection results in a dangerous diseases.

Coronaviruses are part of the virome of the respiratory tract. Mostly the they are beneficial e.g. by protecting against more pathogenic viruses such as RSV or influenza A. Coronaviruses can become pathogenic when they reach to high numbers or growth at/infect the wrong locations, members of the microbiome can become pathogenic.



## Introduction
Life form interactions are ubiquitous on earth. Some interactions are lineage permanent (i.e. stable across generations), some lifetime permanent and some vary throughout lifetime. The mitochondria in eukaryotic cells is an example of a lineage permanent coupling. An other example of a lineage permanent coupling are the retroviruses integrated inside the genome of eukaryotes. The transition from infections with permanent coupling to loose coupling is continuous: Many plant viruses are transmitted vertically (from one generation to the next generation) and also in the case of animals vertical transmission is prevalent e.g. herpes viruses can be transmitted vertically. The microorganisms closely associated but not lineage permanently coupled form the microbiome. 

> ###### Microbiome
> The microbiome are the microorganisms in a certain environment. The environment can be an organisms.

 In the case of bacteria or fungi the coupling often is not that tight and they kept the ability to live outside of multicellular hosts, the hosts on the other hand need bacteria (e.g. for proper digestion) but the bacteria are often replaceable. However not all bacteria are able to live outside of the host e.g. some bacteria are obligate intracellular. Viruses, by definition without ribosomes are always intracellular. 

> The term virus is not uniquely defined in science. On this page viruses are defined as life forms which depend on external ribosomes ([Chapter Intro to Viruses](../2_biological/viruses.md)).

The viruses inhabiting an organism form the virome:

> ###### Virome
> The virome are the viruses in the microbiome.

Both the inner part and the outer surfaces of multicellular organism are inhabited by microorganisms. Special locations of multicellular organisms are the surfaces of the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract. These surfaces can be both view as being on the outside since these surface can be reached without breaching a cell layer and on the inside when considering the 3 dimensional arrangement or the control of accessibility. For most parts these surfaces are covered with protecting mucus and thus they are called mucosal surfaces. These surfaces and the spaces they enclose provide a habitat for a variety of microorganisms forming the mucosal microbiome. The mucosal microbiome consists of different life forms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. Positive stranded RNA viruses such as coronaviruses or rhinoviruses are part of the respiratory tract virome.



## Detection of Virus Infections
Virus infections can be detected by a variety of methods such as laboratory methods detecting virus components, inspecting tissues for changes, or immune responses induced upon infection. Nearly all methods are geared towards diagnosing diseases: Symptom analyses or detection of tissue damage nearly exclusively work if there is a disease. To investigate the virome in the healthy state is difficult since 1) there's usually no (visible) tissue change, 2) the viral load is usually low and 3) the immune response very subtle. Diagnosis with a focus on the diagnosis of the Covid-19 disease is discussed in the chapter ([Chapter Diagnosis and Viral Load](../3_medical/diagnosis_and_viral_load.md)).

To detect the virome in healthy state, PCR tests can be used, when accounting for the low sensitivity at low viral loads. At viral loads below 10^5 virions/milliliter the PCR sensitivity starts to decrease (chapter on [PCR](../3_medical/pcr_diagnosis.md)). In Ct values this corresponds to roughly 35 cycles for most apparatuses. The sensitivity is a challenge to detect infections since:
* *Low Viral Load:* Even at the location of infection in healthy state persistent infections the viral load is mostly below 10^4 virions per milliliter of respiratory tract fluid. 
* *Infection Locations:* Some viruses, e.g. coronaviruses, infect frequently the conducting airways. The conducting airways in the lower respiratory tract are not easy accessible for specimen collection, for this reason mostly the nose or the mouth are sample. The latter works quite well for high viral loads, since to some extent the virions get distributed. For low virus counts, the counts are further decreased upon distribution and often are below the limit of detection.



## How many Members of a certain Type cause a Disease


### Coronavirus Viral Load Ranges and Significance

Amount | #virions per ml | ~ Ct Value | Significance 
--|--|--|--
'Very Few'| < 100 | > 40 | This viral load is mostly not detected. Whether healthy people can be persistently infected with such low viral loads is possible but hardly investigated. Such infections are not clinically relevant but may have an epidemiological relevance since the viruses evolve.// As of October 2020 nearly nothing is published about viral loads beyond 40 for any coronavirus.
'Few' | 1000 | 35 | Mostly asymptomatic. Sometimes people are persistently infected with such intermediate viral loads. The risk for such infections is higher in immunocompromised and there is also evidence that the currently prevalent muscular administrated vaccines (specifically observed for the 'mRNA' vaccine BNT162b2) sometimes yield incomplete immune responses which enable persistent infection with such viral loads [to cite].
'Intermediate' | 10^6 | 25 | With a million virions per milliliter, there are usually symptoms i.e. there is a disease. 
'High' | 10^9 | 15 | With a billion of viruses per milliliter (!) one is usually severely sick.
Comments:
* The relation between the virions number and the Ct value depends on the exact PCR method including the primer(s) used.
* The above values are the viral load in the upper respiratory tract samples. In the upper respiratory tract the viral load is highly variable.
* In the lower respiratory tract fluids the viral load tends to be more stable than in the URT. In the lower respiratory tract already a viral load above 10^6 virions per milliliter is a severe disease and may cause pneumonia and require hospitalization [to confirm and cite].
