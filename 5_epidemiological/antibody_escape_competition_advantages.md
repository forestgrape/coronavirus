# Thoughts on Competition Advantages and Transmissibility of SARS-2 Variants and Strains

> explorative chapter

## Summary
Since early in the SARS-2 pandemics new variants arose. Often these variants just have a few point mutations. When a competitive advantage against others variants is observed, often a higher transmissibility is inferred. In the following it is argued that a competitive advantage is not necessarily the result of a higher transmissibility but can also result from immune evasion (even at low seroprevalence) or from faster but not increased transmission:
* Immune Evasion at low Seroprevalence: The Covid spread is highly individual, this motivates to define individual R values. The distribution of this R values is uneven with many individuals having low R values while a few have very high R values. If a Covid variant can now reinfect people with high R values, it has a competition advantage over variants which can't. 
* Faster Infection: Some variants just infect faster which makes their waves peakier. Such variant have competitions advantages over slower variants but the transmissibility is not higher. 

Finally we look in vitro experiments are discussed and how to interpret them regarding transmissibility.

## Hypothesis 1: Immune Escape can result in a Significant Competition Advantage even at low Seroprevalence

### Model: The Overall R value of a Variant is the Average of the R Values of the Individuals Susceptible to a Variant
The Covid spread is uneven: with a few yielding many secondary cases while many don't transmit Covid well. The uneven spread motivates to define individual R values. The overall R value of a SARS-CoV-2 variant then calculates as averaging the individual R values of the persons susceptible to transmit the variant in question. If a variant is able to reinfect those with high R values, its has a competitive advantage over other variants and its observed R value is much higher than for variant which need to spread through population groups with low R values.

Remark: The immune escape does not necessarily be an escape from neutralizing antibodies but can also be from T cell and non-neutralizing antibody epitopes. 

### Observations on the Skewed Spreader Distribution
Epidemiological and experimental observations show that: 
* few people infect many others while most infected have no secondary cases.
* some people exhale much more aerosol than others.
* People with live in dense living conditions are much more likely to get infected and to spread Covid.



## Hypothesis 2: Faster Infections Cycle can yield a Competition Advantage
The competition advantage is due to peculiarities of the Covid spread:
* Super spreading situations contribute to the spread of Covid. If in a super spreading situations a fast and a slow strain spread, the fast strain will outcompete the slow variant.
* Avoiding crowded indoor space is important to reduce the spread. If a fast infecting and transmitting variant has an advantage in the sense it may transmit before a Covid case realizes to take the necessary precautions. 
* Even for people with a good immune system, a fast infecting variant may transmit before immune protections are in place.

### Advantages on Super Spreading Situations
The spread of Covid is often driven by super spreading and situations which enable super spreading. Settings  where super spreading is possible:
* crowded and confined settings with dry air.
* people with are exhale a lot of infectious aerosol.
These settings are not uniformly distributed in time. Especially in times when protection measures are changed. If now two variants super spread at the same at the same occasion, the faster spreading variant wins the competition since:
* Between the SARS-2 variants and strains there's much cross immunity, so one variants at least partly protects against another.
* once infected with a SARS-2 variant the immune system is alert and it is unlikely that a new variant can infect soon after (even if it manages to at least partly escape the acquired immunity induced by the other variant). This is not only true for coronavirus variants but generally for respiratory tract virus infections: Usually only one virus at the time can infect the respiratory tract and the alertness of the immune system prevents other virus infections in the coming weeks.

### Advantages against Fast Immune Systems
Slow infecting coronaviruses such as SARS-1 and MERS take long to built up some viral load which is mostly possible in risk patients. All strains of SARS-2 are already faster than SARS-1 and MERS, however there can be variation about the SARS-2 strains. When a variant is now able to infect really fast, the spread can happen through more people. 
* So it possible that the spread becomes more evenly distributed. 
* Fast infecting has also disadvantages since the infections within the body tend to be more local which makes it easier for the immune system to fight the infection.

### Advantage in Circumventing Precaution Measures
* Often some time is needed to acknowledge feeling unwell.
* Contact tracing needs some time, which may work less well if the variant infects really fast.


## Evidence for Competition Advantages without Increased Transmissibility
Observations for the spread of the new variants: At low prevalence new variants usually spread quickly and faster than existing variants (e.g. 20AEU1 or B 117). However once dominant, the measures that worked for the other variants are still enough to reduce the case numbers.
* Fast strains especially in situations when the measures are lessened (either by policy or because of lessened adherence): Alpha Variant
* Immune evasion variants often in settings with high seroprevalences.

### Evidence for Competition Advantages due to Immune Escape
#### Observed for other Coronaviruses
For other coronaviruses, both for the endemic human coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, OC43 and E229) and coronaviruses of domestic animals (e.g. bovine coronaviruses) it is observed that new strains replace old strains. But the new strains which outcompeted the old strains usually don't yield increased waves or otherwise show higher transmissibility. Usually the new strains replace the old strains by escaping the previously acquired immune protection [citations on the way].

#### Observed for other Respiratory Viruses

### Evidence for Competition Advantages due to Faster Infections Cycles
#### Observed Spread of the Alpha Strain


### Evidence
The alpha strain (B1.1.7) which likely has a faster infection cycle due to th


but not overall Transmission Advantages of New Variants
