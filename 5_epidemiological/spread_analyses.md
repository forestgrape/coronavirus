## Short Summary
[Situations where high rates of Covid-19 transmission](#spread-situations) are observed or *not* observed are described. Key findings:
* High transmission rates of severe Covid are observed in situations where much air is exchanged between people. Much air is exchanged when spending a lot time indoors without good ventilation, in crowded confined settings, at high altitude and when deep breathing (e.g. sports, singing). 
* Most severe cases and high fatality rates are observed in dry air. The air is dry when heating, air-conditioning or the outdoor air is dry.
* High fatality rates are mostly in regions where many are obese and/or exposed to polluted air.



## Summary

### Summary Findings
#### Covid transmits through Breathed Air
1. Covid-19 transmission correlates to the amount of air people breadth from each other.
The amount of exchanged air is high:
   * Indoors air with bad ventilation (either heated or air-conditioned) 
   * Increased inhaling
     * being at low air pressure (either high altitude or airplane) 
     * vocal activities such as singing or shouting
     * strains e.g. sports. For people where ther air exchanged is lowered (e.g. arteriosclerosis) already going up a staircase can be enough.
3. In settings where droplet transmission but no aerosol transmission is likely, namely in crowded outdoor settings such as demonstrations or swimming pools, transmissions of symptomatic Covid-19 seem not to occur.
4. In settings where contact and fomite transmission is likely (e.g. no water to wash , eating with hands), there is no evidence for transmissions of symptomatic Covid, neither populations based nor through contact-tracing (e.g. camping grounds, Take away food).
  
The observation strongly indicate a generalized aerosol transmission model (either aerosol or dry form transmission [Summary Airborne Transmission](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#overview-airborne-transmission)). For the droplet transmission model the distance and speaking method would be expected to matter most.

Regarding prevention measures relevant is, that the transmission increases with the amount of air exchanged. The exact transmission mechanism may provide additional insights and help fine-tuning but mostly it can be abstracted away.

#### Dry Air => Many Severe Covid Cases
* Many cases of severe Covid-19 are nearly exclusively observed in settings with dry air. Which can be heated, air-conditioned or dry outdoor air.
* At relative air humidities above 50% indoors (and no air-conditioners running) severe Covid cases are rare but some cities such as Lagos in Nigeria have quite high seroprevalences. 

Possible explanations: 
* In dry air, the virion viability is higher and that dry particles stay longer in the air & have a higher lung deposition rate. 
* In humid air the immune system in the respiratory tract works better and particles get deposited earlier in the respiratory tract where the immune system is better prepared to control SARS-2.

#### Individual Differences and Immune System Preparedness
* People with a adequate and in form immune system in the lung mostly get mild diseases and are much less infectious. These include young people and especially children for whom Covid is no more dangerous than common cold viruses and influenza.
* People who been exposed to dirty air (smoking and/or air pollution), conducted unhealthy lifestyles such as few movement and severe obesity or just are of old age may fail to induce an adequate immune response and are thus at a much increased risk for severe Covid. 
* Regarding transmission a failure of an adequate immune response together with a strong metabolism is especially risky.



### Summary Geographical Observations and Analyses

#### Geographical Settings with Increased Spread of Severe Covid
Covid-19 waves across the world are predated by uncomfortable climate conditions:
* _Cold Outdoors:_ Cold temperatures below 15 degrees during the day and below 10 degrees at night => indoor heating => dry indoor and often badly ventilated air
* _Hot & Rich:_ Hot outdoor air temperatures above 30 degrees or above 25 degrees combined with intense sun. But only in countries where air-conditioners are widespread (mostly wealthier, industrialized countries). => indoor air is recirculated and additionally ACs reduce the humidity (often below the )
* _Very Dry Air:_ Very dry outdoor air at moderate temperatures or high temperatures: Middle East (where also MERS spreads in the dry air indoor air), Northern India close to the foothills of the Himalaya (e.g. Delhi, Uttarakhand, Chandigarh).

#### Geographical Settings with Mainly Mild Covid
* High absolute humidity of outdoor air but no air-conditioners and dense living conditions. Examples: Coastal india (except tourism regions in the South like Goa and Puducherry where ACs are likely widespread), Lagos in Nigeria, Indonesia.

#### Geographical Settings with Few Spread 
* Climate with favour ventilation and being outdoors. E.g. rural regions around the world as long as the outdoor temperatures are don't motivate indoor heating.


### Summary Situation Analyses
Nearly all observed spread events are indoors or at least in semi-confined settings such as football matches in stadiums with visitors. On the other hand, for situations with crowded events during the day in unconfined settings (e.g. demonstrations or crowded swimming pools) no increased spread was observed (neither by contact tracing nor monitoring of the overall cases).

#### Situations with an **increased** spread of severe Covid:
* [Large Scale Sporting Events](#large-scale-sporting-events) In sports clubs where spectators are/were allowed to the stadiums, the players have a much higher risks to get infected with Covid-19 than in regions without spectators. Moreover Covid-19 incidence rates seem to be higher in areas with large scale sport events (especially indoor). 
* [Airplanes](#airplanes): High spread rates observed without adequate prevention measures (mask, ventilation). 
* [Large Scale Production Factories](#large-scale-production-factories): Multiple large outbreaks observed mainly in food production factories around the world.
* [Large Buildings](#living-conditions): In cold seasons small living spaces are associated with an increased spread.

#### Situations where no increased spread is observed:
* In regions/settings with limited access to water for washing hands, which is mostly relevant before eating. E.g. for outdoor take away food no increased transmission has been observed even though hand washing is often waved.
* Crowded settings during the day in unconfined settings: Neither superspreading nor steep increases in the populations for repeated events (e.g. demonstrations, crowded parks, beaches and swimming pools).


### The Susceptibility and Infectiousness varies across People and depends on Biological Factors
The susceptibility and infectiousness are correlated and depend on factors such as age, BMI, sex ... Factors increasing the risk for severe infections tend to increase also infectiousness.
* [Schools and Children](#schools-and-children): Children are less susceptible to infection and they spread Covid less than adults. 
* Obesity, male sex and age increase the risk for severe Covid and infectiousness (observed for influenza and the generation of aerosol) [refs coming]
* [Population](#population): Analyzing the spread across people: 20% are responsible for 80% of the infections [**in work**].

    Measures: General Curfew implemented quite early in Spring 2020.
    Covid Cases: Very high number of severe cases and many deaths.

#### Brazil
Spring 2020:


### USA

### Europe
> in work


### India
> in work
#### Spring 2021
* High number of severe cases close to the foothills of the Himalaya in urban centres such as Delhi and Chandigarh. These cities have very dry air in the spring season due to katabatic winds from the Himalaya which is still snow covered in Spring (especially in the March, April).
* High number of severe cases in the tourism regions in the South such as Goa or Puducherry.  These regions have warm and humid climate in the Spring often due to South winds. Due to tourism air-conditioning is likely widespread (tourism brings culture, technology and money).





## Geographical Analyses

> **in rework**, May 2021

### Conditions which Favour Shared Indoor Air
Covid-19 waves across the world usually are predated by situations which favour time spent indoors and bad ventilation which are heating in harsh climates and air-conditioners in hot and humid climates.

#### Low temperature => Indoor Heated
When the temperatures are below the comfort zone, at least during the night, the time spend indoor increases and the windows tend to be closed.

Situations with many severe Covid cases:
* Northern countries in Winter
* Southern in the Southern Hemisphere Winter
* High altitude, High altitude also increases the amount of air breathed.

#### Hot & Rich => Air-Conditioned
ACs are prevalent if 1) in Regions with high temperatures over prolonged periods. Usually inside latitudes of +/- 30 degrees and if the degree of mechanization is high (often associated with a median gdp/person above 10'000 $).

Situations with many severe Covid cases:
* Southern US in summer: E.g. Los Angeles, Florida, Texas and Arizona
* South Americas: Brazil
* Region of Mexico (Mexico City?)
* Some parts of Southern Europe: regions of Spain, Portugal, Greece
* Most Countries in the Middle East

#### High Altitude => Low Pressure
Spread is increased at high altitude since the volume of air breathed is increased.

Situations with many severe Covid cases:
* In Central and South America a couple of large cities are above 2000 meters: Mexico City, La Paz in Bolivia, Quito in Ecuador, Bogota in Colombia
* Winter sport locations in the Alps and Rocky Mountains.

#### Settings which favour staying indoors => Indoors Air Breathed Increased
* In large cities people tend to spend more time indoors than on the country side and with many residential blocks 
* Measures that motivate to stay at home and avoid outdoor activities, not always are beneficial since they increase the time spend indoors. Additionally they can yield respectively enhance unhealthy lifestyles and thereby increase susceptibility for severe Covid. For people living in houses with  gardens (and regions where many people life in houses) staying home can work or at least not increase the spread. On the other hand in settings with [small living spaces](#living-conditions), where already an increased transmission is observed, measures which increase the time spend indoor or visiting indoor places can yield additional transmissions.


### Air Humidity

#### Observations
##### Dry Indoor Air
Nearly all steep increases in severe cases and deaths have been observed in settings where the indoor air is dry. 
* [Indoor Heated](#indoor-heated): Warming the air increases the maximal absolute humidity.
* [Air Conditioned](#air-conditioned): ACs remove humidity.
* Dry Outdoor Air: Examples: Peru Spring 2020, Northern Central India Spring 2021

##### Humid Indoor Air
The indoor air is humid if the outdoor air is humid and no air-conditioners (or dehumidifiers)are used.
* There have been increases in Covid deaths in settings where humid indoor is possible due to humid and warm outside air, but mostly in regions where air-conditioners are frequently used (e.g. Large cities in Northern Brazil nearly year round, South Brazil in Summer, Cities in Southern US summer 2020, Tourism Regions in Southern India Gao). Gao
* In regions where AC are less prevalent and the air keeps humidity indoors combined with dense living conditions (e.g. Indonesia, Lagos in Nigeria, large cities (e.g. Mumbai) of coastal India): High prevalence of Covid-19 has been detected but mainly mild cases with very low fatality rates.

#### Interpretations of Air Humidity
Air humidity is relevant in theory since:
* the viability of coronavirus virions is increased in dry air (below efflorescence humidity) (-> [Page Virion Viability](../2_biological/virion_viability.md))
* In humid and warm temperature environments (above 30 degrees), the death numbers increase less steep. [Chan](#chan) shows that warm temperatures of 33 Celsius and high relative yield a much faster rate of inactivation; temperatures over 38 degrees do induce a much faster inactivation. A possible explanations why in humid conditions around 33 degrees there less super-spreading events observed are:
* In humid environments, organic particles act as condensation nuclei and therefore loose their dry form. So viruses "find" themselves within growing droplets, which fall to the ground or get absorbed in the upper respiratory tract causing less virulent diseases.
  * In warm climate zones good ventilation is easy but settings with air-conditioner usage enable super spreading.

* The virions lung deposition locations can change. When dried particles have hygroscopic growth the dangerous alveoli deposition is possibly increased (-> [Particle Dynamics in the Respiratory Tract](../5_epidemiological/transmission.md#deposition-factors))



### Dirty Air Exposure
> in work
#### Air Pollution
_Through Air Pollution_: Examples (in decreasing order, source: estimates from watching the maps at ventusky.com): Northern India, Central and Northern China (including Wuhan), Northern Italy, Teheran

#### Smoking
_Through Smoking_: Smokers and Ex-Smokers. 
* Ex-smokers have a higher risk for severe risk than never smokers.

> Current smokers seem to have no higher Covid risk than never smokers, but a lower risk than former smokers. This could be attributed (possibly toxic) environment changes in the lung caused by smoking. However [local environment changes in the lungs](../6_prevention_and_treatment/temperature_modulation.md) can also be achieved with sauna or steam inhalation which don't have the health hazards of smoke.

### Lifestyles
#### Overweight
> in work

##### Observations
Countries with high rates of obesity tend to have much more severe cases than countries with lower rates but otherwise similar characteristics. 


High rates of obesity (in decreasing order, source: obesity.procon.org):
US, Jordan, Turkey, Mexico, UK, Hungary, Israel, Czechia

Few obesity: Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Japan

##### Interpretation
> One reason is that obesity increases the risk for severe Covid. But the increases seems to occur also in people which are no obese [to check and cite/provide evidence].




<!--
For regions across the world the following is analysed:
* Covid-19 cases and deaths to find Covid-waves i.e. time spans with increased spread
* geographical, climate and social situations including measures to flatten/prevent Covid 
  * while cases increase i.e. during the Covid-19 waves 
  * while Covid-19 decrease or stay low despite having a relevant population of possible Covid spreaders (the spread in regions with very low case count where contact tracing can work, behave differently and will be analysed in future)



### Spread Analyses in South Americas
Most countries in South Americas recorded many cases, a notable exception is Uruguay with very few cases and only a couple of deaths. The geographic and social situation are hugely different across the Continent. 
All countries provided programs for financial support and additionally:
- Nationwide Quarantines: Argentina, Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile[to Check]
- Stay at home recommendation: Uruguay
- No/few nationwide rules: Brazil

-->

### Cities versus Rural
A main distinguishing feature between rural and cities is that in rural areas people are segregated by geographical distance (corresponding a lower population density over entire regions) and thus the time to travel while in cities people tend to be segregated by social factors such as interest/jobs/hobbies/age/world views. The distance separation induces well defined clusters (villages). Social factors yield clusters to but the borders are softer and the clusters are different for each social factor. 
Infectious disease wave through the clusters until there's no more ground to nourish. 

##### Rural
* Segregated by mobility
* Life is often outdoors or distributed indoor rooms during the day but in the evening the society is tightly connected. 

##### Urban
* not segregated by mobility (but by social factors) which yields a different segmentation for each factor
* life is often indoors but distributed. 
* People belong to different clusters trough a day 

#### Observations
* In less densely populated provinces (more rural and smaller cities) the Covid-waves are more steep and shorter i.e. the incidence curve is more peaked compared to the incidence curves in large cities (Observation and simulations by [Rader,Scarpino et al](#summary-rader,scarpino)).

> I also except that in rural settings: 
> * the peak incidence will be much higher (double or more) and the wave passes through the entire society in one go. 
> * lower death rates (probably 2/3) due to immune systems better adapted to viruses. 


### Living Conditions

#### Living Space
People in neighborhoods in cities with small living areas and a low incomes are more frequently infected and contribute above average to the spread of Covid. Small living space is correlated to low income which in turn is correlated to jobs where home office is less possible (e.g. service)  
* [Brueningk et al](#summary-brueningk) deduce the Covid-19 spread from SARS-2 genome sequencing: Small living space (and low incomes) are key factors for increased spread. 
* [Lundkvist et al](#lundkvist) observe that in Stockholm people living in suburbs with large buildings built in the 60s have a seroprevalence of 30%, compared to a seroprevalence of 4% for people living in modern building (likely some form of ventilation is built in).

#### Residential Blocks
Across the world regions and communities with a large share of people living in residential blocks tend to have higher Covid infections rates:
* Large cities in the UK which have high shares of residential blocks, had high severe Covid case rate. [to confirm and cite/source]
* In Eastern Europa, where the share of residential blocks built in the 60s through 80s is high, Covid case rates where high during the winter 20/21.
* In the Lombardy the share of people living in residential blocks is high. Severe Covid rate were very high in late Winter 2020 and still quite high in Winter 2021.


### Income

#### Income Effects within Cities
In some cities in Western Europe (e.g. in Basel, Stockholm -> [References Living Space](#living-space)), a negative correlation between income and Covid cases is observed within 'commuting areas' i.e. analyzing only areas within commuting distances. Within commuting/catchment areas  the income usually is correlated to the [living space](#living-space), which is possibly a founding cause. Also jobs which require physical presence in large buildings (e.g. fabrics) tend to have low wages.

#### Income Effects between Cities
When comparing income in larger areas than commuting distances, there the negative correlation between income and Covid cases does not hold: 
* rural areas with low incomes show no increased Covid case count compared to rich cities [to provide data/cite]

#### Income Effects on the Country Level
On the country level Covid cases and deaths are positively correlated to income.

## Analyses of Historical Transmissions

> written March 2020, in rework May 2021

* The initial cases that led to the discovery of Sars-CoV-2 occurred  during cold outdoor air temperature and therefore dry indoor air in the Wuhan Sea Food market. Pictures of the market suggest that the market is partly indoor and therefore likely heated. The zoonoses of Sars-Cov-1 also are linked to a live animal market or civets kept inside restaurants.
* The primary spreading indoors can be a reason  this new betacoronavirus diseases occurred recently, even though overall hygiene increased. There are other possible explanations however: One is that the diagnostic tooling improved enabling the discovery of these diseases (MERS, discovered in 2012, has been infecting humans at least for several decades, which is known from analyzing backup samples [to cite]).

## Analyses of specific Settings

Spread situations and patterns of Covid-19 both observed and described in literature are discussed. 

### Medical and Care Facilities

##### Hospitals
> in rework May 21

In settings without prior SARS experience the infection rate in health care workers is very high:
* 2003 in South East Asia  (see Introduction [Mizumoto](#mizumoto))
* 2019/2020 in Europe - Italy especially [LE](#le)
	
Possible Explanation: The medical staff is used to protect against fomites and droplet transmission and to some extent versus aerosol transmission and know to handle them. However, they are not yet used to the new spreading pattern. Consequently in all rooms of the building wearing a mask likely is key in reducing the infection rates (many cities in China reported few infections in hospitals [citations to be added]).

##### Long Term Care Facilities
Long-Term Care Facility in Seattle [Honein et al](#honein).

### Indoor Social Settings
* [Contact Tracing in Hong Kong](#summary-ada,mwu) revealed that transmission in social settings (bars, weddings, temples) was associated with more secondary cases than households.


### Cruise Ships

#### Diamond Princess
Diamond Princess Cruise Ship anchored in Japan, well analysed by [Mizumoto and colleagues](#mizumoto).

##### Observation
* Covid-19 spread started between passengers and not equally between passengers and personal.
* Very high peak values of the reproduction number are observed (over 10).
##### Interpretation
The observations indicate long range but same room transmission which favours aerosol over droplet transmission:
* In the droplet model, one would except the personal to be crucial for the junction of the different guest groups, since they have the most short range contacts, which enable droplet transmission.
* Smoke diffuses entire rooms and stays quite long => spending much time in the same confined rooms is more relevant than interactions or being close but only for a short period. Therefor an initial spread in passengers is expected (if the initial spread starts in the passengers) since they spend the time in the same areas.
* The reproduction number peak values are well above the number of close contacts a person usually has and so droplet transmission is unlikely.

The observed spread patter even favour small or dry particulates over larger aerosol particulates, since for larger particles are more local spread would be excepted:
* For 'large' aerosol transmission about an equal spread would be expected.


### Airplanes
[**in work**]
* [Freedman and Wilder-Smith](#freedman) is a concise review about the knowledge on airplane transmission as of September 2020. Table 1 in their paper summarizes all studies the studies they reviewed. 
  Key points:
  * "In-flight transmission of SARS-CoV had previously been demonstrated during the symptomatic but not asymptomatic phase of illness. In 2003, up to 22 transmissions occurred on a single f light from a single index case;1 conversely, several other carefully stud- ied flights resulted in no transmission."
  * For SARS-2 two super-spreading events (more than 10 transmissions) have been observed. Both in March when no adequate aerosol protection measures were in place. Both index cases were symptomatic. 
  * Since strong protection measures are in place only few transmissions have been described. 
  * Protection measures in airplanes:
    * Screens for symptoms at boarding time (asymptomatic patients have been frequently overlooked but they rarely caused transmissions.
    * Masks (mostly permanent but often meals are served)
    * Ventilation is not mentioned in the paper from [Freedman and Wilder-Smith](#freedman), see [Ventilation in Airplanes](#ventilation-in-airplanes)

#### Ventilation in Airplanes
Ventilation:  Airlines seem to have optimized ventilation to have a high air exchange (20 times per hour) and the air flow is from top to bottom (and not anymore from front to back) [citations in work].


### Factories
Around the world in many large scale production factories especially in those preparing food (e.g. meat, bread), large Covid-19 outbreaks among the personal have been observed [citations/sources in work].

#### Analysis Factories
> Noteworthy that often food production factories are concerned. This could be due to low temperatures and no sunlight, in these settings the [virion survive long](../2_biological/_site/virion_viability.md).[To check whether they reuse filtered air and what temperature/humidity settings]


### Large Scale Sporting Events
Large scale sporting events provided likely ground for ultra-spreading events. The evidence for this is currently based on:
* Players and staff were very frequently infected yielding to many cancellations of matches. Infections are very rare in countries with fan bans. Sport events settings (number of spectator and protections measures) and infected players and populations in the appendix: [Sport Events](#sport-events).
* The increase of Covid-19 cases seems to be steeper in regions where spectators of large scale sporting events live (steep increases in Switzerland regions where ice-hockey spectators are, increase in Nether) [to check and verify]
* Sport events settings (number of spectator and protections measures) and infected players and populations in the appendix: [Sport Events](#sport-events).


> October/November 2020: There's no proof yet as fare as I know. But evidence strong enough to **not allow spectators** anymore in Covid risk regions. Clarify the picture: Prevalence of Covid-19 in the spectators either through antigen/PCR (PCR: ideally whole genome sequencing to backtrace the transmission pathways) or by studying seroprevalence rates. 

> In epidemiology too: *Exploring and trying combined with measurements, consideration and analyses help* to understand SARS-CoV-2 including its transmission. 


## Other Viruses
### Betacoronaviruses
#### SARS-CoV-1
* _Hotels_: Hotel in Hong Kong, especially during cooler outdoor air temperatures [Lin](#lin), [Chan](#chan). The virus spread to guests in rooms on the same floor. Spread to personal was rarely observed.

#### Mers-Cov:
Most superspreading events were observed in winter and often in hospitals ([Dudas et al 2017](#dudas-2017)).

### Alphacoronaviruses


### Respiratory Viruses

* Perez-Lopez et al analysed the effect of school closures on respiratory viruses. [Summary of Perez-Lopez et al](#summary-perez-lopez) and commented in the [Schools and children section](#schools-and-children).

---



## Population Characteristics
Knowing how infectors are distributed, can help to fine-tune control measures. 


### Infector Distribution
Contact tracing in Hong Kong revealed that [Adam et al](#summary-adam,wu):
* 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
* 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
* 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in 


### Infectors and Symptom Status
 Note: The strains prevalent during the time of investigation is relevant since coronaviruses can diminish or activate the immune system.
 * In early 2020 over 80% developed symptoms.

* [Adam et al](#summary-adam,wu) found in January through April in Hong Kong 2020 only 2.2% (7 in 309) of the infections were caused by pre-symptomatic people.
* The two mass infection events observed in airplanes were both caused by symptomatic infectors [Freedman and Wilder-Smith](#freedman). 
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that in household settings symptomatic infectors cause about 3 times as many infections as pre/asymptomatic infectors. 


### Schools and Children
Children are less likely to be infectees and less likely to be infectors.

A recommended review is [COVID-19 Transmission and Children: The Child Is Not to Blame](#leeraszka) by B. Lee and W. Raszka. Notable findings from the studies are below and summaries of most studies are in [Summarized References](#summarized-references).

* [Dattner et al](#summary-dattner) observed that children are relative to adults
  * less susceptible 45% [40%, 55%]) 
  * somewhat less infectious 85% [65%, 110%])
* [Madewell et al](#summary-madewell) find that children are only about half as likely to get infected in households compared to adults (spouses which are most likely to get infected and the adult infections are biased by relationship habits).
* [Vlachos, Hertegard and Svaleryd](#summary-vlachossvaleryd) found that parents children in the 9th school year (open schools)had about the same incidence rate for Covid-19 as parents children in the 10th school year (closed school). If adjusted for factors such as age and occupation the risk was about 15% higher for being diagnosed with Covid-19 when the child went to open schools. // Comment: this indicate that other factors are more important than whether the children go to school. 
* Large high school outbreak in Israel shortly after reopening of the schools. The outbreak was probably due to aerosol super-spreading from teacher(s) which was enable by densely populated rooms and the permanent use of air-conditioning [Summary Stein-Zamir](#summary-stein-zamir). 
* [Ehrhardt et al](#summary-ehrhardtbrockmann) observed in Baden-Wuertenberg between 19 May to 28 July:
  * 6 of 137 infected pupils infected a total of 11 other pupils (an R value contribution of below .1)
  * 3% of infections of children (0-19 year) could be traced back to schools. Where as 41% to families and 8% to festivals/events.
* [Perez-Lopez et al](#summary-perez-lopez) published statistics about viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from visits in Sidra Medicine, the main pediatric center in Qatar. They observed a significant 30 fold reduction for influenza A. A 30% reduction was observed for influenza B and Common HCoVs. //Comment: Their observations indicate that in school settings only the influenza A transmission is efficient and other viruses are transmitted mainly in setting other than schools. This in turn indicates that for most viruses adults play the major role in the transmission.

* 0.32 (.025)

Comparison with SARS-1 or MERS:
* SARS-1: 0.06 (0.04)
* MERS: 0.035 (0.035)

> ##### Comment
> Studies from countries with high and very high Covid prevalence are included too, in these countries independent infections pathways for different household members are likely and thus inferring the secondary attack rate from the prevalence in household members overestimates the secondary attack rate.

Adam D, Wu P, Wong J, et al. Research Square; 2020. [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-29548/v1]()

##### Methods
"Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection."

##### Results
* Distribution of Infectivity:
  * 20% of the cases induced 80% of infections
  * 10% of the cases induced 20% of infections
  * 70% of the cases induced no observed infections (despite most of them being not in quarantine, Fig.2)
* "Gatherings in social settings such as bars, restaurants, weddings and religious sites appear to be at increased risk of superspreading events."
* "Transmission in social settings was significantly associated with an increased number of secondary cases compared to transmission observed in family households."
* Quarantine
  * Home quarantine yielded sporadic infections (2 observed) in family settings (Fig.2 d) and none outside families
  * Government quarantine yielded no further infections (Fig.2)
* "Of all cases confirmed in Hong Kong, 195 (18.8%, 195/1,038) were asymptomatic at confirmation (Supplementary Table 2) and, of these, most (83.1%, 162/195) were PCR-confirmed from 27 March onward" (Extended Data Fig.2)
* Infections caused by pre-symptomatic infectors were rarely observed: "Seven instances of likely pre-symptomatic transmission were observed where onset of the infectee preceded that of the infector or occurred on the same day."

##### Limitations
"These findings take advantage of the quality of case ascertainment and contact tracing data in Hong Kong, although some incompleteness in links between cases could potentially bias our estimates of transmission heterogeneity."

##### Methods
[in work]
The spread of the cluster 20A.EU1 in Europe is analyzed by comparing genome sequences. The cluster 20A.EU1 is defined as "The cluster was initially identified as a monophyletic group of sequences stemming from the larger 20A clade with amino acid substitutions at positions S:A222V, ORF10:V30L, and N:A220V or ORF14:L67F (overlapping reading frame with N), corresponding to nucleotide mutations C22227T, C28932T, and G29645T. In addition, sequences in 20A.EU1 differ from their ancestors by the synonymous mutations T445C, C6286T, and C26801G. There are currently 19,695 sequences in the cluster by this definition."

##### Findings
[in work]
* "The prevalence of early samples in Spain, diversity of the Spanish samples, and prominence of the cluster in Spanish sequences suggest Spain as the likely origin for the cluster, or at least the place where it first expanded and became common."
* "Lentiviral particles with the A222V mutant spike had slightly higher titers than those without (mean 1.3-fold higher), although the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. S2). Therefore, A222V does not lead to the same large increases in the titers of spike-pseudotyped lentiviral that has been observed for the D614G mutation (Korber et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020), which is a mutation that is now generally considered to have increased the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 (Plante et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2020)."

  2. For 453 School attendance information was available
  3. 137 (30% of 453) were at least 1 day at school while infectious 
  4. 11 other pupils were infected by 6 of those 137
  5. no secondary infection from those 11 were detected despite extensive contact tracing
* only 15 (3%) of 453 infected children (with school attendance known) were infected in schools (the 11 above from other pupils and 4 by teachers). Most infections occurred in families or festivals/events (Table 2).

##### Methods
Remark: Working Paper
* "Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions."
* the incidence rates were adjusted using logistic regression for wage, sex, occupation, educational attainment, income, regions of residence and of origin. OLS was used too. 

##### Results
* Comparison of Covid-19 incidences between parents with children in schools and homeschooling:
  * unadjusted the Covid incidence were near the same 5.67 versus 5.66 (Table 2)
  * adjusted the risk for parents with children in school was about 15% [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03–1.27] higher if adjusted with logistic regression(Table 1)
* "Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52–2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00–1.68]."

> ##### Comment
> It is not clear that the observed slightly increased Covid incidence of parents/teachers of lower secondary school children results from transmission from the children, it could also be attributed to parents visiting the schools and a transmission between adults.

##### Methods
Analyzing a large high school out break in Israel shortly after schools have been reopened. 

##### School Setting
* From 13 March to 17 May Schools in Israel were closed (limited opening for small children on 3 May)
* A heat wave with temperatures up to 40 degree from 19–21 May: 
  * "air-conditioning functioned continuously in all classes."
  * no face-masks
* "crowded classes: 35–38 students per class, class area 39–49 m2, allowing 1.1–1.3 m2 per student"

##### Results
* "Testing of the complete school community revealed 153 students (attack rate: 13.2%) and 25 staff members (attack rate: 16.6%) who were COVID-19 positive."
* "COVID-19 rates were higher in junior grades (7–9) than in high grades (10–12) (Figure 1). The peak rates were observed in the 9th grade (20 cases in one class and 13 cases in two other classes) and the 7th grade (14 cases in one class). Of the cases in teachers, four taught all these four classes, two taught three of the four classes and one taught two of these four classes."
* "Most student cases presented with mild symptoms or were asymptomatic."

**The role of children in the spread of COVID-19: Using household data from Bnei Brak, Israel, to estimate the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children**

##### Methods
* "Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak (City close to Tel Aviv), Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR."
* The authors developed a model (discrete stochastic dynamic model) for the propagation of Covid within a household. With this model infectivity and susceptibility for children and adults can be estimated.
 
##### Findings
* 44% of adults and 25% of children infected
* infection risk increases with age (except children below 1 year compared to children between 1 and 4)
* For children the susceptibility was 45% [40%, 55%] and the infectivity 85% [65%, 110%] in comparison to adults.

##### Goal
Figure out the effect of population densities (crowding), mobility, humidity on the overall and the temporal distribution of Covid-19 incidences. 

##### Methods
The incidence rates of Covid was analysed in China and Italy.
Their work consists of two parts: 
1. A spread analysis, using various statistical methods.
     * Regions which published independent Covid cases were considered as units. In China these were provinces [to confirm]. 
     * For each unit the population density is determined.
     * To measure how peaky the incidence curves are, Shannon entropy is calculated. 
2. The spread is simulated. The simulation is done for different population models [to check].

##### 1. Analysis Results
* lower density = sparse (rural areas): 
  * more peaked incidence rates, most of the infections are within 20 days (Figure 1a)
  * lower cumulative incidence (final attack rate)
* high density = crowded (large cities): 
  * less peaked incidence rates, most of the cases are within 40 days (Figure 1a)
  * higher cumulative incidence rates
##### 2. Simulation Results
* lower density = sparse: 
  * intervention measures cause the incidence curve to flatten out and moderately reduce total case count (Figure 3 c and d)
* high density = crowded: 
  * intervention measures are crucial since without interventions prolonged spread with high numbers of infected is predicted (Figure 3 c and d)

##### Results
In Norra Djurgårdsstaden, modern residential blocks in the upper price class, 4.1% of study participants had SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In Tensta a suburb with low cost apartments in large residential blocks (built in the 60s and 70s), 30% of the participants tested antibody positive.

medRxiv 2020.12.15.20248130; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248130

##### Methods
The influence of 4 socioeconomic factors (Living space per person, Median Income, 1-person households, Seniority) on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is analysed based on sequence data and a computer simulation. In a second step, the effect of reduced transmissibility of population subgroups on the spread of Covid is simulated. 

>  The term vaccinated is used in the paper but since it is unknown (as of 27.1.2021) whether the available vaccines produce a useful immunity regarding transmission and there are other methods (e.g. testing, masks, natural immunity) to reduce transmissibility the term reduced transmissibility is used here.

##### Methods Details
* Sequence Information: "In total 247 cases within the time period from the 25th of February until the 22nd of April were included in this analysis. For all data a seven day moving window average was taken to account for reporting bias on weekends, and cumulative numbers of infected cases (compartment I) were calculated."
* Simulation: "SEIR-model. Similar to previous work [20, 52, 53] the spread of the epidemic within the city of Basel was described using a compartmental two-arm SEIR model including both sequenced, and unsequencend/unreported cases."
* Serology: "We determined SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in a total of 2,019 serum samples collected from individuals between 25th of February and 22nd of May, 2020, to account for sero-conversion. The cohorts included healthy blood donors and patients from the University Hospital Basel with residency in Basel-City, and Viollier AG Zurich, a lab medicine provider contracted for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing."

##### Results
People belonging to the thirds with the smallest living space per person have the largest pre-lockdown effective reproductive number (shown in Figure 3). Similarly people in the lowest income (which is likely well correlated to the living space) have a high reproductive number. Reducing the transmissibility of the people belonging to the lowest living space third or the lowest income third reduces and delays the maximal icu occupancy (Figure 7).

##### Results Details
* Mobility:
  * "We observe that low and median income populations are more mobile than their wealthier counterparts. Moreover, there is little mobility within areas with a low share of 1-person households, a result of the predominantly peripheral location of the relevant statistical blocks (see Figure S5). For living space per person or percentage of senior citizens, mobility was comparable between tertiles with a trend towards higher mobility within the younger population groups."
  * "For living space per person or percentage of senior citizens, mobility was comparable
146 between tertiles with a trend towards higher mobility within the younger population groups."
* "We found that blocks with a higher median income (2% achieved significance), or higher living space per person (1% achieved significance), or lower share of 1-person households (2% achieved significance) had a significantly lower Ref f (< 1.7) relative to the maximum Ref f observed in the relevant partition."
* "Serology information was used to estimate the fraction of unreported cases as follows: An estimated 1.88% (38/2,019) of the Basel-City population was infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of these 60% would be attributed to the B.1-C15324T strain, leading to a percentage of 88% of unreported/unsequenced cases to consider."

##### Methods
* " However, the role of city size and structure in shaping transmission patterns of seasonal influenza is not well understood. We address this here using 6 years (2002 to 2008) of data on weekly incidence of influenza- like illness (ILI) in 603 three-digit postal (ZIP) codes across the United States, assembled from medical claims data (34)."
##### Results
* "We find that differences in nj among cities persist across years—some cities have consistently more intense epidemics than others, year after year. "
* "Cities with higher mean intensity tend to be located in the east, have smaller population sizes, and have higher-amplitude seasonal fluctuations in specific humidity." (Fig 1 D-F)
* "Increasing base transmission potential can decrease epidemic intensity in a seasonally forced compartmental epidemic model." (Fig 2)
* Population size and crowding increase the base transmission potential. (Fig 3 F,G)

[**in work**]
* Netherlands: 15 - 35% of capacity until 1.10. 
* Switzerland:up to 2/3 of capacity [to check] allowed between 1.10.20 and 28.10.20 both for ice hockey (indoor) and football. All fans needed to wear a mask (of any type) but were allowed to drink (including alcoholic beverages).
* Ukraine: allowed in mid October (exact dates to be checked)
* Belgium: up to 400 outdoors and 200 indoors allowed from 23.9. to 23.10.
* Russia: still several thousand fans seem to be allowed in football [as indicated by stadium counts on 4.11.]
* Turkey: several hundred fans seem to be allowed in football [as indicated by stadium counts on 4.11.] [to check]
* UK: After a 4 week lockdown which ended on 2nd December 2020 until 5.1.2021 ([Appendix UK Sport Data](#data-uk-sport-events)):
  4000 spectators in Tier 1 (about 10%-15% of capacity)
  2000 spectators in Tier 2 (about 5%-7.5% of capacity)

#### Results from Leagues with Spectators
Sources: [https://www.sofascore.com](), [https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/scores-fixtures](), [https://www.srf.ch/sports]() [accessed in early November]
* Netherlands
  * A very steep increase of Covid-19 cases in early October
* Switzerland
  * only 6 out of 12 football games took place between 21.10 and 4.11. The other 6 needed to be cancel due to quarantine of whole teams (multiple infected players and staff members). Some teams had most of their players and staff infected. 
  * many regions with ice hockey stadiums respectively where the spectators live showed a steeper increase in Covid-19 cases than the regions without ice hockey stadiums. This indicates regular super-spreading events (as fare as the public available data indicate). 
  * in late October the majority of hockey matches needed to be cancelled since many teams had multiple infected players.
* Ukraine:
  * Shakhtar Donetsk had in early October 2020, 9 infected players and 9 infected staff members. [other teams to be checked]
  * Some players of the Ukraine national football team had positive PCR tests in mid November 2020.
* Belgium 
  * 4 of 17 matches cancelled between 21.10. and 4.11., despite an increasing Covid prevalence throughout October most matches need to be cancelled until mid October when spectators still were allowed. Nevertheless the cancels can also be due to the overall very high Covid-19 prevalence in Belgium. 
* Turkey 
  regular cancellation of matches due to insufficient players 
* Russia
  [to check]
* UK (Period 3.12. - 5.1.) ([Appendix UK Sport Data](#data-uk-sport-events))
  * Multiple match cancellation.
  * A steep increase in case counts. // before 3.12. there was a lockdown/shutdown and on the 3.12. pubs and restaurants were reopened in most regions. Considering that only a couple of thousands spectators were allowed in a couple of large stadiums, it seems unlikely sport events played aj major role in the increased overall spread.
  * An increase in infected players. However the increase in infected players is only slightly steeper than the general case count increase.
    * 23.11. - 13.12:  30 (3 Weeks; 3 Rounds)
    * 21.12 - 10.1.: 94 (3 Weeks; 4 Rounds; some matches cancelled and these high risk teams likely not tested)
  * // Some evidence that spectators increased the number of infected players. Even though there were some matches cancelled, the increase in infected players was not much steeper than the general case count; however in september/october/november the correlation between case counts and infected players is rather low. 



#### Results from Leagues without Fans
* UK (no spectators until 2.12.): between 21.10. and 4.11. all matches (16) have been played
* Netherlands (allowed only until 1.10.): between 21.10. and 4.11. all matches (18) have been played
* Germany: no matches cancelled [to confirm]
